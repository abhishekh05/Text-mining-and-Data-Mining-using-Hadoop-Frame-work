AdvertisementSupported byBy Adam LiptakWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday adopted a strict interpretation of a federal immigration law, saying it required the detention of immigrants facing deportation without the possibility of bail if they had committed crimes, including minor ones, no matter how long ago they had been released from criminal custody.The vote was 5 to 4, with the court’s more conservative justices in the majority. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority, said the plain language of a federal law required the result.Justice Stephen G. Breyer summarized his dissent from the bench, a sign of profound disagreement. He said the majority had violated the nation’s basic values.“The greater importance of the case,” he said, “lies in the power that the majority’s interpretation grants the government. It is a power to detain persons who committed a minor crime many years before. And it is a power to hold those persons, perhaps for many months, without an opportunity to obtain bail.”Justice Alito said the law may be subject to constitutional challenges in individual cases, a subject that was not before the justices. It was clear, he wrote, that Congress had required the secretary of Homeland Security to take into custody immigrants released from criminal custody even if years had passed in the meantime.“An official’s crucial duties are better carried out late than never,” Justice Alito wrote.Cecillia Wang, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the immigrants challenging the law, said the decision was part of a worrisome trend.“For two terms in a row now,” she said, “the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge.”The case concerned a law, enacted in 1996, which included a contested phrase. It said federal authorities “shall take into custody any alien” convicted of certain crimes, some serious and some minor, “when the alien is released.” The key word was “when.”Immigrants’ rights advocates said the law required prompt detention. Lawyers for the federal government said immigrants convicted of crimes may be detained years after their release.The difference matters, for hundreds and perhaps thousands of immigrants, because people detained under the law are not entitled to a bail hearing to determine whether they are dangerous or pose a flight risk.The plaintiffs included people who entered the country illegally, tourists or students who overstayed their visas and lawful permanent residents. Among them were immigrants who arrived in the United States legally as infants, committed minor crimes like possessing marijuana and were detained years after completing their sentences.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, concluded that the law requires mandatory detention only if the federal authorities take immigrants into custody soon after they are released.“Because Congress’s use of the word ‘when’ conveys immediacy,” Jacqueline H. Nguyen wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel, “we conclude that the immigration detention must occur promptly upon the aliens’ release from criminal custody.”Justice Alito wrote that such a strict deadline could allow local authorities opposed to federal immigration policy to frustrate the goals of the federal law.“State and local officials sometimes rebuff the government’s request that they give notice when a criminal alien will be released,” he wrote. He cited statistics indicating that there were tens of thousand of such refusals in 48 states from January 2014 to September 2016.“Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that Congress made the secretary’s mandatory-detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an alien’s release,” he wrote.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh joined all or most of the majority opinion.In a concurring opinion, Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the question before the court was a narrow one.He said it was beyond dispute that the government can deport immigrants convicted of some crimes and that it can detain them during deportation proceedings.The question the court decided, he wrote, was merely whether “the executive branch’s mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody.”It would be odd, he wrote, for that requirement to change, for example, “if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen because of resource constraints or because the executive branch cannot immediately locate and apprehend the individual in question.”In dissent, Justice Breyer wrote that the case was neither narrow nor technical.“Under the government’s view,” he wrote, “the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier, and may have established families and put down roots in a community.”“These aliens,” Justice Breyer wrote, “may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes — for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of ‘moral turpitude’ such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person.”Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent in the case, Nielsen v.

He said the majority had violated the nation’s basic values.“The greater importance of the case,” he said, “lies in the power that the majority’s interpretation grants the government. It is a power to detain persons who committed a minor crime many years before. And it is a power to hold those persons, perhaps for many months, without an opportunity to obtain bail.”Justice Alito said the law may be subject to constitutional challenges in individual cases, a subject that was not before the justices. It was clear, he wrote, that Congress had required the secretary of Homeland Security to take into custody immigrants released from criminal custody even if years had passed in the meantime.“An official’s crucial duties are better carried out late than never,” Justice Alito wrote.Cecillia Wang, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the immigrants challenging the law, said the decision was part of a worrisome trend.“For two terms in a row now,” she said, “the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge.”The case concerned a law, enacted in 1996, which included a contested phrase. It said federal authorities “shall take into custody any alien” convicted of certain crimes, some serious and some minor, “when the alien is released.” The key word was “when.”Immigrants’ rights advocates said the law required prompt detention. Lawyers for the federal government said immigrants convicted of crimes may be detained years after their release.The difference matters, for hundreds and perhaps thousands of immigrants, because people detained under the law are not entitled to a bail hearing to determine whether they are dangerous or pose a flight risk.The plaintiffs included people who entered the country illegally, tourists or students who overstayed their visas and lawful permanent residents. Among them were immigrants who arrived in the United States legally as infants, committed minor crimes like possessing marijuana and were detained years after completing their sentences.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, concluded that the law requires mandatory detention only if the federal authorities take immigrants into custody soon after they are released.“Because Congress’s use of the word ‘when’ conveys immediacy,” Jacqueline H. Nguyen wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel, “we conclude that the immigration detention must occur promptly upon the aliens’ release from criminal custody.”Justice Alito wrote that such a strict deadline could allow local authorities opposed to federal immigration policy to frustrate the goals of the federal law.“State and local officials sometimes rebuff the government’s request that they give notice when a criminal alien will be released,” he wrote. He cited statistics indicating that there were tens of thousand of such refusals in 48 states from January 2014 to September 2016.“Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe that Congress made the secretary’s mandatory-detention authority vanish at the stroke of midnight after an alien’s release,” he wrote.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh joined all or most of the majority opinion.In a concurring opinion, Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the question before the court was a narrow one.He said it was beyond dispute that the government can deport immigrants convicted of some crimes and that it can detain them during deportation proceedings.The question the court decided, he wrote, was merely whether “the executive branch’s mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody.”It would be odd, he wrote, for that requirement to change, for example, “if the executive branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen because of resource constraints or because the executive branch cannot immediately locate and apprehend the individual in question.”In dissent, Justice Breyer wrote that the case was neither narrow nor technical.“Under the government’s view,” he wrote, “the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier, and may have established families and put down roots in a community.”“These aliens,” Justice Breyer wrote, “may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes — for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of ‘moral turpitude’ such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person.”Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the dissent in the case, Nielsen v.

To the Editor:Re “Trump Appeals Directly to U.S. for Border Wall” (front page, Jan. 9):In his brief address from the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday night, President Trump relied on tired stories of immigrant violence that he has often repeated, backed by statistics of dubious validity and delivered in his typically nonemotive style. Mr. Trump’s advisers thought this speech would move the nation and cause a dramatic shift in public sentiment to support the wall or take the onus of the government shutdown off him. They were wrong.Arguably, the speech is simply a sign of his desperation. The man is consumed by an obsessive need to fulfill a campaign pledge punch line. He seems to believe that to abandon the wall might risk losing some of his core base, the same group whose good will he may need to help him overcome a future impeachment challenge.Mr. President, as you have done so many times in your two years as president, your speech further debased the dignity of the office. In the past, Oval Office speeches have been reserved for true national crises, not those manufactured to serve a president’s own political self-interest.

They need to give the president reassurance that he won’t be scolded and punished by far-right conservative media.Mark BradyDix Hills, N.Y. AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Sheryl Gay StolbergWASHINGTON — President Trump attacked Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday for rejecting his proposal to end the partial government shutdown, as he and Republican leaders in Congress sought to put Democrats on defense, a place they have rarely been during the shutdown stalemate.In a series of morning tweets, Mr. Trump said Ms. Pelosi had behaved “so irrationally” in spurning his offer to restore the temporary protections he took away from some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. He also pushed back against conservative critics who called the plan amnesty for immigrants who came to the United States illegally.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, plans to bring up legislation as early as Tuesday that would wrap Mr. Trump’s proposal into a broader package that would include billions of dollars in disaster relief and immediately reopen the government, an aide said. The move is intended to ratchet up pressure on Democrats, who have insisted they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump until the shutdown is over.“President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, said on Twitter. “The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.”But there was little indication from Democrats, who have denounced Mr. Trump’s plan as “hostage taking,” that they would abandon that position.“If he opens up the government, we’ll discuss whatever he offers, but hostage taking should not work,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters in New York on Sunday, adding, “It’s very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head.”With the shutdown now in its fifth week, and 800,000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay, pressure is rising on both Republicans and Democrats to end it. If it lasts until Friday, Congress will be forced to reckon with another grim milestone: Affected workers will miss their second paycheck.[Read: Trump’s Deal Meets With Skepticism Among Immigrants in Texas]As Republicans go on offense in the Senate, Democrats will stay on offense in the House, where they have already passed a string of government funding bills that Mr. McConnell — who has largely remained on the sidelines during the shutdown debate — has refused to take up. On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi plans to bring up a package of six bills to fund shuttered government agencies, ignoring Mr. Trump’s requests.The measures gained approval last year from Republicans on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees; in effect, Ms. Pelosi will be daring Republicans to vote against their own legislation. Democrats will also begin talking more about their own vision for border security — a shift in strategy for a party that has focused mostly on the economic and personal toll of the shutdown.Amid the posturing, however, there were some hints that Mr. Trump’s proposal, which he unveiled in a 13-minute White House address on Saturday, might open the door to talks that could result in a deal. Vice President Mike Pence, in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” suggested that Mr. Trump’s proposal might be amended on the Senate floor.“Well, of course,” Mr. Pence said, when the host, Chris Wallace, asked if he was open to negotiation. “The legislative process is a negotiation.”And Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a centrist Democrat, described Mr. Trump’s plan as “a starting point” on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” though he added, “You’ve got to start by reopening the government.”The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected.Polls show the public largely blames Mr. Trump for the shutdown, and his advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Last week, Mr. McConnell told Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence and White House advisers that he needed the president to put forth a public offer so he could bring legislation to the floor.“McConnell’s view of shutdowns is when you’re in one, it’s a great opportunity for both sides to get things,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and former McConnell aide who remains close to him. “And what I think is dumbfounding everyone here is: Why aren’t the Democrats treating it as a situation where they could get something? The president has opened the door for them to get something, so let’s talk.”Throughout his administration, Mr. Trump has sought to limit both legal and illegal immigration. Last year, he moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. He also revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., for some undocumented immigrants from Latin American and African countries.In the plan he unveiled on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore the DACA and T.P.S. protections for three years. But Democrats say that is a nonstarter, because it does not offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, and because Mr. Trump is simply giving back protections that he himself took away.The McConnell aide, Don Stewart, said the Republican legislative package would include seven appropriations bills that would fund government agencies that have been partially closed for a month.“The legislation that the majority leader will bring to the floor this week would both reopen the remaining portions of the government, fund disaster relief, fund border security and address immigration issues that both Republicans and Democrats would like to address — all in one bill,” Mr. Stewart said.Mr. McConnell would need votes from all Republicans and seven Democrats for the package to pass. But only a handful of Democrats in Republican-leaning states might feel pressured enough to cross the aisle. A spokesman for one of them, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, said Mr. Manchin — who just won re-election — would remain undecided on the Republican proposal until he saw it.In broadening the package beyond Mr. Trump’s plan, Mr. McConnell may be trying to pick up additional Democrats — especially those who are eager to vote for disaster relief.“He’s starting to move the pieces around to see what’s going to fly and what’s not going to make it,” said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader from Nevada. “He’s trying to put the pressure back on Democrats, and he’s trying to see what the possibilities of a deal are by putting a larger package there. He’s trying to see how large the package has to be to bring Democrats on board.”But Mr. Trump seemed to be holding fast. He retweeted a series of endorsements of his proposal from Republican lawmakers on Sunday evening, and earlier in the day, he took aim at Ms. Pelosi and pushed back against conservative critics who have described the plan as amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They don’t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 — which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.”Mr. Trump went on: “Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the ‘lefties’ in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!”And to his conservative critics, Mr. Trump wrote: “No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally — but be careful Nancy!”Ms. Pelosi took to Twitter to strike back. “@realdonaldtrump, 800,000 Americans are going without pay. Re-open the government, let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect the border,” she wrote, using the hashtag #EndTheShutdown.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Sheryl Gay StolbergWASHINGTON — President Trump attacked Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday for rejecting his proposal to end the partial government shutdown, as he and Republican leaders in Congress sought to put Democrats on defense, a place they have rarely been during the shutdown stalemate.In a series of morning tweets, Mr. Trump said Ms. Pelosi had behaved “so irrationally” in spurning his offer to restore the temporary protections he took away from some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. He also pushed back against conservative critics who called the plan amnesty for immigrants who came to the United States illegally.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, plans to bring up legislation as early as Tuesday that would wrap Mr. Trump’s proposal into a broader package that would include billions of dollars in disaster relief and immediately reopen the government, an aide said. The move is intended to ratchet up pressure on Democrats, who have insisted they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump until the shutdown is over.“President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, said on Twitter. “The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.”But there was little indication from Democrats, who have denounced Mr. Trump’s plan as “hostage taking,” that they would abandon that position.“If he opens up the government, we’ll discuss whatever he offers, but hostage taking should not work,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters in New York on Sunday, adding, “It’s very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head.”With the shutdown now in its fifth week, and 800,000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay, pressure is rising on both Republicans and Democrats to end it. If it lasts until Friday, Congress will be forced to reckon with another grim milestone: Affected workers will miss their second paycheck.[Read: Trump’s Deal Meets With Skepticism Among Immigrants in Texas]As Republicans go on offense in the Senate, Democrats will stay on offense in the House, where they have already passed a string of government funding bills that Mr. McConnell — who has largely remained on the sidelines during the shutdown debate — has refused to take up. On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi plans to bring up a package of six bills to fund shuttered government agencies, ignoring Mr. Trump’s requests.The measures gained approval last year from Republicans on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees; in effect, Ms. Pelosi will be daring Republicans to vote against their own legislation. Democrats will also begin talking more about their own vision for border security — a shift in strategy for a party that has focused mostly on the economic and personal toll of the shutdown.Amid the posturing, however, there were some hints that Mr. Trump’s proposal, which he unveiled in a 13-minute White House address on Saturday, might open the door to talks that could result in a deal.

Re-open the government, let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect the border,” she wrote, using the hashtag #EndTheShutdown.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Sheryl Gay StolbergWASHINGTON — President Trump attacked Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday for rejecting his proposal to end the partial government shutdown, as he and Republican leaders in Congress sought to put Democrats on defense, a place they have rarely been during the shutdown stalemate.In a series of morning tweets, Mr. Trump said Ms. Pelosi had behaved “so irrationally” in spurning his offer to restore the temporary protections he took away from some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall. He also pushed back against conservative critics who called the plan amnesty for immigrants who came to the United States illegally.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, plans to bring up legislation as early as Tuesday that would wrap Mr. Trump’s proposal into a broader package that would include billions of dollars in disaster relief and immediately reopen the government, an aide said. The move is intended to ratchet up pressure on Democrats, who have insisted they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump until the shutdown is over.“President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, said on Twitter. “The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.”But there was little indication from Democrats, who have denounced Mr. Trump’s plan as “hostage taking,” that they would abandon that position.“If he opens up the government, we’ll discuss whatever he offers, but hostage taking should not work,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters in New York on Sunday, adding, “It’s very hard to negotiate when a gun is held to your head.”With the shutdown now in its fifth week, and 800,000 federal employees still furloughed or working without pay, pressure is rising on both Republicans and Democrats to end it. If it lasts until Friday, Congress will be forced to reckon with another grim milestone: Affected workers will miss their second paycheck.[Read: Trump’s Deal Meets With Skepticism Among Immigrants in Texas]As Republicans go on offense in the Senate, Democrats will stay on offense in the House, where they have already passed a string of government funding bills that Mr. McConnell — who has largely remained on the sidelines during the shutdown debate — has refused to take up. On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi plans to bring up a package of six bills to fund shuttered government agencies, ignoring Mr. Trump’s requests.The measures gained approval last year from Republicans on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees; in effect, Ms. Pelosi will be daring Republicans to vote against their own legislation. Democrats will also begin talking more about their own vision for border security — a shift in strategy for a party that has focused mostly on the economic and personal toll of the shutdown.Amid the posturing, however, there were some hints that Mr. Trump’s proposal, which he unveiled in a 13-minute White House address on Saturday, might open the door to talks that could result in a deal. Vice President Mike Pence, in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” suggested that Mr. Trump’s proposal might be amended on the Senate floor.“Well, of course,” Mr. Pence said, when the host, Chris Wallace, asked if he was open to negotiation. “The legislative process is a negotiation.”And Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a centrist Democrat, described Mr. Trump’s plan as “a starting point” on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” though he added, “You’ve got to start by reopening the government.”The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected.Polls show the public largely blames Mr. Trump for the shutdown, and his advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Last week, Mr. McConnell told Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence and White House advisers that he needed the president to put forth a public offer so he could bring legislation to the floor.“McConnell’s view of shutdowns is when you’re in one, it’s a great opportunity for both sides to get things,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and former McConnell aide who remains close to him. “And what I think is dumbfounding everyone here is: Why aren’t the Democrats treating it as a situation where they could get something? The president has opened the door for them to get something, so let’s talk.”Throughout his administration, Mr. Trump has sought to limit both legal and illegal immigration. Last year, he moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of young unauthorized immigrants known as Dreamers. He also revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., for some undocumented immigrants from Latin American and African countries.In the plan he unveiled on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore the DACA and T.P.S. protections for three years. But Democrats say that is a nonstarter, because it does not offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, and because Mr. Trump is simply giving back protections that he himself took away.The McConnell aide, Don Stewart, said the Republican legislative package would include seven appropriations bills that would fund government agencies that have been partially closed for a month.“The legislation that the majority leader will bring to the floor this week would both reopen the remaining portions of the government, fund disaster relief, fund border security and address immigration issues that both Republicans and Democrats would like to address — all in one bill,” Mr. Stewart said.Mr. McConnell would need votes from all Republicans and seven Democrats for the package to pass. But only a handful of Democrats in Republican-leaning states might feel pressured enough to cross the aisle. A spokesman for one of them, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, said Mr. Manchin — who just won re-election — would remain undecided on the Republican proposal until he saw it.In broadening the package beyond Mr. Trump’s plan, Mr. McConnell may be trying to pick up additional Democrats — especially those who are eager to vote for disaster relief.“He’s starting to move the pieces around to see what’s going to fly and what’s not going to make it,” said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader from Nevada. “He’s trying to put the pressure back on Democrats, and he’s trying to see what the possibilities of a deal are by putting a larger package there. He’s trying to see how large the package has to be to bring Democrats on board.”But Mr. Trump seemed to be holding fast. He retweeted a series of endorsements of his proposal from Republican lawmakers on Sunday evening, and earlier in the day, he took aim at Ms. Pelosi and pushed back against conservative critics who have described the plan as amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They don’t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 — which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.”Mr. Trump went on: “Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the ‘lefties’ in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!”And to his conservative critics, Mr. Trump wrote: “No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer.

But Democrats say that is a nonstarter, because it does not offer a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, and because Mr. Trump is simply giving back protections that he himself took away.The McConnell aide, Don Stewart, said the Republican legislative package would include seven appropriations bills that would fund government agencies that have been partially closed for a month.“The legislation that the majority leader will bring to the floor this week would both reopen the remaining portions of the government, fund disaster relief, fund border security and address immigration issues that both Republicans and Democrats would like to address — all in one bill,” Mr. Stewart said.Mr. McConnell would need votes from all Republicans and seven Democrats for the package to pass. But only a handful of Democrats in Republican-leaning states might feel pressured enough to cross the aisle. A spokesman for one of them, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, said Mr. Manchin — who just won re-election — would remain undecided on the Republican proposal until he saw it.In broadening the package beyond Mr. Trump’s plan, Mr. McConnell may be trying to pick up additional Democrats — especially those who are eager to vote for disaster relief.“He’s starting to move the pieces around to see what’s going to fly and what’s not going to make it,” said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader from Nevada. “He’s trying to put the pressure back on Democrats, and he’s trying to see what the possibilities of a deal are by putting a larger package there. He’s trying to see how large the package has to be to bring Democrats on board.”But Mr. Trump seemed to be holding fast. He retweeted a series of endorsements of his proposal from Republican lawmakers on Sunday evening, and earlier in the day, he took aim at Ms. Pelosi and pushed back against conservative critics who have described the plan as amnesty for undocumented immigrants.“Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak,” Mr. Trump wrote. “They don’t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 — which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.”Mr. Trump went on: “Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the ‘lefties’ in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!”And to his conservative critics, Mr. Trump wrote: “No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally — but be careful Nancy!”Ms. Pelosi took to Twitter to strike back. “@realdonaldtrump, 800,000 Americans are going without pay. Re-open the government, let workers get their paychecks and then we can discuss how we can come together to protect the border,” she wrote, using the hashtag #EndTheShutdown.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Glenn ThrushWASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday that it would start blocking a small number of asylum seekers from entering the United States from Mexico, using the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego as the first location to turn back immigrants applying for refugee status.The policy to block asylum seekers was first announced last month by Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It will gradually be expanded over the next two weeks at border crossings with heavy foot traffic in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, according to a senior United States official briefed on the move, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The move is intended to dissuade immigrants, mostly from Central America, from making the long and dangerous journey through Mexico to the southwestern United States border. The policy is likely to intensify pressure on the Mexican authorities, who are already struggling to deal with thousands of Central American immigrants who have applied for humanitarian visas in Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala.It will apply both to some asylum seekers who try to enter the United States at border crossings and to people who are stopped while illegally trying to enter. Asylum seekers generally have been allowed to wait in the United States, often for years, for their cases to be processed.The number of pending immigration cases has grown by nearly 50 percent under President Trump, what many lawyers and advocates say is a crisis.“For far too long, our immigration system has been exploited by smugglers, traffickers and those with no legal right to be in the United States,” said Ms. Nielsen, who described the new protocol as a “methodical common-sense approach” in a statement late Thursday.While she cited the danger posed by adults and criminals, a fact sheet explaining the justification for the new policy, described as “migrant protection protocols,” cited an unmanageable influx of children and families from Central America as the main reason for the change.The protocol was necessary to counter “misguided court decisions and outdated laws that have made it easier for illegal aliens to enter and remain in the U.S.,” Ms. Nielsen said. Under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the new policy can be enforced immediately without congressional approval, she added.Despite President Trump’s efforts to limit refugees, the number of migrants who asked for asylum last year out of fear of returning to their home countries jumped nearly 70 percent from 2017, according to Department of Homeland Security data. Nearly 60 percent of all foreigners asking for asylum were people in families.The announcement was made on Thursday amid tense negotiations between American and Mexican officials over how the policy would be carried out. It was primarily intended to relieve pressure on American immigration officials, but the senior official said it was also intended to highlight what the White House has called a “humanitarian crisis.”Mr. Trump shut down the government over a month ago over demands that House Democrats allocate $5.7 billion for the construction of a wall along the southwestern border. His plan failed in the Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday, leaving no clear path for an end to the longest funding lapse in American history.Under the new policy, asylum seekers who are turned back to Mexico will receive a notice informing them of their right to be heard in United States immigration court after 45 days, officials said.Immigrants rights groups are expected to challenge the move in court, and they are likely to argue that forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexican border cities puts them at greater risk in a region known for its high murder rates.The Mexican authorities had long expected the move, but were taken aback when they were told early on Thursday that the plan would take effect on Friday.That will force the Mexican government to create a system for processing, housing and protecting the asylum seekers who would now congregate on their side of the border.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Glenn ThrushWASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday that it would start blocking a small number of asylum seekers from entering the United States from Mexico, using the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego as the first location to turn back immigrants applying for refugee status.The policy to block asylum seekers was first announced last month by Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The policy is likely to intensify pressure on the Mexican authorities, who are already struggling to deal with thousands of Central American immigrants who have applied for humanitarian visas in Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala.It will apply both to some asylum seekers who try to enter the United States at border crossings and to people who are stopped while illegally trying to enter. Asylum seekers generally have been allowed to wait in the United States, often for years, for their cases to be processed.The number of pending immigration cases has grown by nearly 50 percent under President Trump, what many lawyers and advocates say is a crisis.“For far too long, our immigration system has been exploited by smugglers, traffickers and those with no legal right to be in the United States,” said Ms. Nielsen, who described the new protocol as a “methodical common-sense approach” in a statement late Thursday.While she cited the danger posed by adults and criminals, a fact sheet explaining the justification for the new policy, described as “migrant protection protocols,” cited an unmanageable influx of children and families from Central America as the main reason for the change.The protocol was necessary to counter “misguided court decisions and outdated laws that have made it easier for illegal aliens to enter and remain in the U.S.,” Ms. Nielsen said. Under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the new policy can be enforced immediately without congressional approval, she added.Despite President Trump’s efforts to limit refugees, the number of migrants who asked for asylum last year out of fear of returning to their home countries jumped nearly 70 percent from 2017, according to Department of Homeland Security data. Nearly 60 percent of all foreigners asking for asylum were people in families.The announcement was made on Thursday amid tense negotiations between American and Mexican officials over how the policy would be carried out. It was primarily intended to relieve pressure on American immigration officials, but the senior official said it was also intended to highlight what the White House has called a “humanitarian crisis.”Mr. Trump shut down the government over a month ago over demands that House Democrats allocate $5.7 billion for the construction of a wall along the southwestern border. His plan failed in the Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday, leaving no clear path for an end to the longest funding lapse in American history.Under the new policy, asylum seekers who are turned back to Mexico will receive a notice informing them of their right to be heard in United States immigration court after 45 days, officials said.Immigrants rights groups are expected to challenge the move in court, and they are likely to argue that forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexican border cities puts them at greater risk in a region known for its high murder rates.The Mexican authorities had long expected the move, but were taken aback when they were told early on Thursday that the plan would take effect on Friday.That will force the Mexican government to create a system for processing, housing and protecting the asylum seekers who would now congregate on their side of the border.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Refusing to change out of her turtleneck on a sweltering day in Pasadena and being captivated by swaying palm trees.That’s most of what Miriam Tellez Sorrosa remembers about arriving in the United States from Mexico when she was 7.“I had not seen palm trees in my life,” she said. “I thought they were going to fall.”Ms. Tellez Sorrosa is now 22 and a “Dreamer” — she’s among the roughly 700,000 young immigrants brought into the United States as children, who were shielded from deportation under the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.She’s getting ready to graduate from Cal State University Fullerton, where she’s worked extensively with other undocumented students through the school’s Titan Dreamers Resource Center.And on Tuesday, at the invitation of Representative Gil Cisneros, she was in the chambers of the U.S. House of Representatives as President Trump delivered his State of the Union address.Mr. Cisneros, who represents the 39th District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino Counties, said he wanted the president to see that students like Ms. Tellez Sorrosa are assets to the country.“This is her home; this is where she wants to make a difference and we need to be embracing that,” he said.While President Trump has consistently used dire language about immigrants who come into the country illegally, his position on DACA recipients has shifted.In 2017, he moved to end DACA, then last month, he offered to extend protections for DACA recipients in exchange for border wall funding.In the State of the Union, he returned to describing a crisis on the border.I talked to Ms. Tellez Sorrosa on Wednesday about visiting Washington and listening to the president. Here’s our conversation, edited for length and clarity.Jill Cowan: What did being at the State of the Union represent for you?I think the biggest thing for me was just understanding the history of it, to think the place where I was going to be was the place where generations of individuals were making laws that now affect me.What being undocumented means to me is my resilient identity. So for me, I feel like it’s almost like a responsibility and a necessity to share my experience.What was it like to be in Washington as the guest of a congressman?Yesterday there was a period of time where I was shadowing him in his meetings and that just blew my mind.What I love about it, too, was that everybody’s experience and narrative is unique and there’s not like, “This person’s guest is more important than this person’s guest.” It was just a handful of American people being present. That was one of the most magical things, to share the room. I feel like that’s what America always strives to be: With the people and for the people.Was there another guest that you really felt like you connected with? I was super excited to hear that there were going to be more DACA recipients attending and there was this moment where we were all in the same room. I was just like, “Yes.”What was it like listening to the speech? In a way, I was happy about where my seat was. I couldn’t really see him. It helped me just listen to what he was saying. There were things where I was like, “I believe this, too.”When he talked about immigration and immigrants, I paid a lot more attention. I think because I’ve known his rhetoric and how he talked about immigrants, that wasn’t a surprise. I was indifferent to it.But I’m learning research now as a sociologist, and I was like, there’s so many potential flaws in this. I want to know where your information is coming from.[Read The Times’s fact check of the State of the Union here.]Do you mind if I ask what you wore? I laugh because I was freaking out about what to wear. I was coming into a space where these people are people with power, economic status, everything. How do I fit in? I think I went the safe route, wearing business professional clothing. I did wear a white shirt in support of a lot of congresswomen.On campus, we have a Dreamers’ graduation and in our Dreamers’ graduation we have a sash. So I actually asked for my sash in advance as a statement piece. I was hoping it would spark dialogue.How are you going to use this experience going forward?I’m definitely not as afraid as I was before.I have until 2020 with my permit. And that’s kind of my safety net, so I’m going to try to do as much as possible while I have DACA and I’m going to continue to advocate for something bigger that will just benefit not only the Dreamers, quote-unquote.Last question: Do you think that you might want to run for office someday? One of my Lyft drivers, as I was telling him about why I’m here, he was like, “I like how you talk, you should run for office.” And I was like, “Would I have your vote?” He was like, “Yes!”Definitely, being here and being present and seeing people being passionate about moving forward the agendas that are important to them and making every single topic special and important has motivated me to get more involved.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Berkeley.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Refusing to change out of her turtleneck on a sweltering day in Pasadena and being captivated by swaying palm trees.That’s most of what Miriam Tellez Sorrosa remembers about arriving in the United States from Mexico when she was 7.“I had not seen palm trees in my life,” she said. “I thought they were going to fall.”Ms. Tellez Sorrosa is now 22 and a “Dreamer” — she’s among the roughly 700,000 young immigrants brought into the United States as children, who were shielded from deportation under the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.She’s getting ready to graduate from Cal State University Fullerton, where she’s worked extensively with other undocumented students through the school’s Titan Dreamers Resource Center.And on Tuesday, at the invitation of Representative Gil Cisneros, she was in the chambers of the U.S. House of Representatives as President Trump delivered his State of the Union address.Mr. Cisneros, who represents the 39th District, which includes parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino Counties, said he wanted the president to see that students like Ms. Tellez Sorrosa are assets to the country.“This is her home; this is where she wants to make a difference and we need to be embracing that,” he said.While President Trump has consistently used dire language about immigrants who come into the country illegally, his position on DACA recipients has shifted.In 2017, he moved to end DACA, then last month, he offered to extend protections for DACA recipients in exchange for border wall funding.In the State of the Union, he returned to describing a crisis on the border.I talked to Ms. Tellez Sorrosa on Wednesday about visiting Washington and listening to the president. Here’s our conversation, edited for length and clarity.Jill Cowan: What did being at the State of the Union represent for you?I think the biggest thing for me was just understanding the history of it, to think the place where I was going to be was the place where generations of individuals were making laws that now affect me.What being undocumented means to me is my resilient identity. So for me, I feel like it’s almost like a responsibility and a necessity to share my experience.What was it like to be in Washington as the guest of a congressman?Yesterday there was a period of time where I was shadowing him in his meetings and that just blew my mind.What I love about it, too, was that everybody’s experience and narrative is unique and there’s not like, “This person’s guest is more important than this person’s guest.” It was just a handful of American people being present. That was one of the most magical things, to share the room. I feel like that’s what America always strives to be: With the people and for the people.Was there another guest that you really felt like you connected with? I was super excited to hear that there were going to be more DACA recipients attending and there was this moment where we were all in the same room. I was just like, “Yes.”What was it like listening to the speech? In a way, I was happy about where my seat was. I couldn’t really see him. It helped me just listen to what he was saying. There were things where I was like, “I believe this, too.”When he talked about immigration and immigrants, I paid a lot more attention. I think because I’ve known his rhetoric and how he talked about immigrants, that wasn’t a surprise. I was indifferent to it.But I’m learning research now as a sociologist, and I was like, there’s so many potential flaws in this. I want to know where your information is coming from.[Read The Times’s fact check of the State of the Union here.]Do you mind if I ask what you wore? I laugh because I was freaking out about what to wear. I was coming into a space where these people are people with power, economic status, everything. How do I fit in? I think I went the safe route, wearing business professional clothing. I did wear a white shirt in support of a lot of congresswomen.On campus, we have a Dreamers’ graduation and in our Dreamers’ graduation we have a sash. So I actually asked for my sash in advance as a statement piece. I was hoping it would spark dialogue.How are you going to use this experience going forward?I’m definitely not as afraid as I was before.I have until 2020 with my permit. And that’s kind of my safety net, so I’m going to try to do as much as possible while I have DACA and I’m going to continue to advocate for something bigger that will just benefit not only the Dreamers, quote-unquote.Last question: Do you think that you might want to run for office someday? One of my Lyft drivers, as I was telling him about why I’m here, he was like, “I like how you talk, you should run for office.” And I was like, “Would I have your vote?” He was like, “Yes!”Definitely, being here and being present and seeing people being passionate about moving forward the agendas that are important to them and making every single topic special and important has motivated me to get more involved.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Here’s our conversation, edited for length and clarity.Jill Cowan: What did being at the State of the Union represent for you?I think the biggest thing for me was just understanding the history of it, to think the place where I was going to be was the place where generations of individuals were making laws that now affect me.What being undocumented means to me is my resilient identity. So for me, I feel like it’s almost like a responsibility and a necessity to share my experience.What was it like to be in Washington as the guest of a congressman?Yesterday there was a period of time where I was shadowing him in his meetings and that just blew my mind.What I love about it, too, was that everybody’s experience and narrative is unique and there’s not like, “This person’s guest is more important than this person’s guest.” It was just a handful of American people being present. That was one of the most magical things, to share the room. I feel like that’s what America always strives to be: With the people and for the people.Was there another guest that you really felt like you connected with? I was super excited to hear that there were going to be more DACA recipients attending and there was this moment where we were all in the same room. I was just like, “Yes.”What was it like listening to the speech? In a way, I was happy about where my seat was. I couldn’t really see him. It helped me just listen to what he was saying. There were things where I was like, “I believe this, too.”When he talked about immigration and immigrants, I paid a lot more attention. I think because I’ve known his rhetoric and how he talked about immigrants, that wasn’t a surprise. I was indifferent to it.But I’m learning research now as a sociologist, and I was like, there’s so many potential flaws in this. I want to know where your information is coming from.[Read The Times’s fact check of the State of the Union here.]Do you mind if I ask what you wore? I laugh because I was freaking out about what to wear. I was coming into a space where these people are people with power, economic status, everything. How do I fit in? I think I went the safe route, wearing business professional clothing. I did wear a white shirt in support of a lot of congresswomen.On campus, we have a Dreamers’ graduation and in our Dreamers’ graduation we have a sash. So I actually asked for my sash in advance as a statement piece. I was hoping it would spark dialogue.How are you going to use this experience going forward?I’m definitely not as afraid as I was before.I have until 2020 with my permit. And that’s kind of my safety net, so I’m going to try to do as much as possible while I have DACA and I’m going to continue to advocate for something bigger that will just benefit not only the Dreamers, quote-unquote.Last question: Do you think that you might want to run for office someday?

Sign up to get it by email.___Parliament approved a bill this week to allow medical evacuation for asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus over the opposition of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, throwing Australia into another visceral debate over immigration.In the coming months, with an election approaching, we can expect to hear all kinds of intense and moralistic rhetoric.Mr. Morrison and his supporters are already arguing that opening the door even a little to settlement in Australia will encourage a flood of migrants and deaths at sea. Labor, the Greens and others on the left are maintaining that immigration is a net positive for Australia and that cruelty must be restrained.This is all part of a broader conversation across the West about migration and national identity; the White House announced just today that President Trump will declare a state of emergency to build a border wall.And it’s a conversation that matters. These disputes, however they end up, will shape many countries, and the world, for decades.But for me, there’s a certain familiarity to the discussion, not just in Washington but also in Canberra.I’ve written about immigration for nearly 20 years, from various countries, from the neighborhoods and towns where immigrants cluster to the halls of power where decisions are made.Along the way, there are a few things I’ve learned to look out for.The Hero Vs. Villain TrapIn heated moments like this one, immigrants and the nuances of their lives and motivations tend to be reduced to the most simplistic of archetypes.Either they are criminals (the worst of the worst, rapists, murders, pedophiles) or they are blameless hard-working heroes (say, doctors or professional basketball players from Australia in the N.B.A.).The reality — and this should be obvious, but often gets overlooked — is that most migrants are in the messy middle with the rest of us. They’re good and bad, they’re parents and workers, and they’re mostly just trying to make life a little bit better for themselves and their loved ones.This idea that they are somehow different and more extreme reflects little more than the political need for narrative and division. Beware of the packaging of simplicity.“It’s a Fact-Free Zone”When I was reporting a series of stories back in 2012 — the first to show that the era of mass Mexican migration was over — an expert I talked to warned that policymakers would ignore my findings.Immigration, he said, is an issue driven by emotion. “It’s a fact-free zone,” he said. And he was right.No matter how many cold hard facts get put into the public domain in the next few months — and I hope there are a lot of them — don’t expect the politicians to adjust their arguments. They’re appealing less to the head than the heart.And look out for what’s missing too.You probably won’t hear anyone, for example, pointing out that the decision to migrate is typically a long-term bet, calculated and paid for over several years, which rarely responds to immediate policy changes in predictable ways.There are both push (from a country) and pull (to a country) factors and, according to sociologists and demographers, it is often impossible to make sweeping cause-and-effect conclusions based on one element alone.Every immigrant has a story all their own. People move and flee for reasons that often have very little to do with what policymakers do to deter or assist them.Interaction WinsDuring a long road trip from the Mexican to the Canadian border, for a project exploring immigration in Middle America, I met dozens of Americans with all kinds of views about immigration.But there are two people, both older white women, who I still think about.One was in Farmers Branch, Texas, an area that had tried, but failed, to push out immigrants who might not be documented with a series of strict residential rental rules and policing. She told me through her locked screen door that she wanted tougher enforcement; she was afraid.Another was in Wichita, in Kansas, in an area that had gone from a declining white, working-class community to one that was reviving but more mixed in terms of ethnicity and origin.The woman’s name was Francene Sharp. You can read her full story here, but what stuck with me was her reaction to a break in at her home by some local Mexican teenagers.She had cause to be angry. But because she’d spent years getting to know many of her other immigrant neighbors — including a friend who she called for help right after the break in — her response and her views were tempered and calm.What she had (that the woman in Texas did not) was real-life interaction, enough of it to prevent her from making sweeping judgments about people or policy.She relied on her own deep experience and a remarkable openness to combat the “fact-free zone” and the “hero/villain trap.”Border policy was on her radar; she was no supporter of “open borders.” But she was far more interested in why those teenagers who broke in were not at home studying. Integration and community mattered more to her than border walls.Which brings me to what I’ll be looking for in this year’s Australian (and American) immigration debate.Will there be people pushing the conversation beyond border enforcement and detention?Who, if anyone, will be asking: How can immigration be studied, discussed and shaped in conjunction with immigrants to ensure that Australia (the country that often calls itself “the world’s most successful multicultural nation”) lives up to that promise?Now for a few stories of the week (plus a few surprising recommendations from Paul Krugman).As always, you can share your thoughts in our NYT Australia Facebook group.

These disputes, however they end up, will shape many countries, and the world, for decades.But for me, there’s a certain familiarity to the discussion, not just in Washington but also in Canberra.I’ve written about immigration for nearly 20 years, from various countries, from the neighborhoods and towns where immigrants cluster to the halls of power where decisions are made.Along the way, there are a few things I’ve learned to look out for.The Hero Vs. Villain TrapIn heated moments like this one, immigrants and the nuances of their lives and motivations tend to be reduced to the most simplistic of archetypes.Either they are criminals (the worst of the worst, rapists, murders, pedophiles) or they are blameless hard-working heroes (say, doctors or professional basketball players from Australia in the N.B.A.).The reality — and this should be obvious, but often gets overlooked — is that most migrants are in the messy middle with the rest of us. They’re good and bad, they’re parents and workers, and they’re mostly just trying to make life a little bit better for themselves and their loved ones.This idea that they are somehow different and more extreme reflects little more than the political need for narrative and division. Beware of the packaging of simplicity.“It’s a Fact-Free Zone”When I was reporting a series of stories back in 2012 — the first to show that the era of mass Mexican migration was over — an expert I talked to warned that policymakers would ignore my findings.Immigration, he said, is an issue driven by emotion. “It’s a fact-free zone,” he said. And he was right.No matter how many cold hard facts get put into the public domain in the next few months — and I hope there are a lot of them — don’t expect the politicians to adjust their arguments. They’re appealing less to the head than the heart.And look out for what’s missing too.You probably won’t hear anyone, for example, pointing out that the decision to migrate is typically a long-term bet, calculated and paid for over several years, which rarely responds to immediate policy changes in predictable ways.There are both push (from a country) and pull (to a country) factors and, according to sociologists and demographers, it is often impossible to make sweeping cause-and-effect conclusions based on one element alone.Every immigrant has a story all their own. People move and flee for reasons that often have very little to do with what policymakers do to deter or assist them.Interaction WinsDuring a long road trip from the Mexican to the Canadian border, for a project exploring immigration in Middle America, I met dozens of Americans with all kinds of views about immigration.But there are two people, both older white women, who I still think about.One was in Farmers Branch, Texas, an area that had tried, but failed, to push out immigrants who might not be documented with a series of strict residential rental rules and policing. She told me through her locked screen door that she wanted tougher enforcement; she was afraid.Another was in Wichita, in Kansas, in an area that had gone from a declining white, working-class community to one that was reviving but more mixed in terms of ethnicity and origin.The woman’s name was Francene Sharp. You can read her full story here, but what stuck with me was her reaction to a break in at her home by some local Mexican teenagers.She had cause to be angry. But because she’d spent years getting to know many of her other immigrant neighbors — including a friend who she called for help right after the break in — her response and her views were tempered and calm.What she had (that the woman in Texas did not) was real-life interaction, enough of it to prevent her from making sweeping judgments about people or policy.She relied on her own deep experience and a remarkable openness to combat the “fact-free zone” and the “hero/villain trap.”Border policy was on her radar; she was no supporter of “open borders.” But she was far more interested in why those teenagers who broke in were not at home studying. Integration and community mattered more to her than border walls.Which brings me to what I’ll be looking for in this year’s Australian (and American) immigration debate.Will there be people pushing the conversation beyond border enforcement and detention?Who, if anyone, will be asking: How can immigration be studied, discussed and shaped in conjunction with immigrants to ensure that Australia (the country that often calls itself “the world’s most successful multicultural nation”) lives up to that promise?Now for a few stories of the week (plus a few surprising recommendations from Paul Krugman).As always, you can share your thoughts in our NYT Australia Facebook group.

Complaints about low wages were ignored. “The manager would say, ‘If you want to work, then work,’” Juan Remigio Licona said in Spanish. “‘If you don’t want to work, you can go.’”Two workers, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino, had logged eight years between them at the carwash when they concluded they did not want to work under those conditions and sought the advice of a lawyer. Both were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who had an imperfect command of English and an imperfect understanding of their rights under U.S. labor law. But in 2011, against long odds, they filed suit against their employer, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor law.The case against J.V. Car Wash (and its sister locations) took some unusual turns, as the carwash owner, José Vázquez, contrived a series of bizarre claims to undermine the workers’ lawsuit. But the really surprising twist to this unlikely story: the carwasheros, as they call themselves, won. By the time the last checks are disbursed this summer, almost eight years after the suit was filed, the 106 workers who eventually signed on as plaintiffs will have received a share of roughly $8.5 million — a spectacular sum for a wage theft case.The average plaintiff award in a wage theft case is less than $6,000, according to Samuel Estreicher, a professor at New York University Law School and director of the school’s Center for Labor and Employment Law. These carwasheros won an average of more than $80,000 per worker.Carwash workers are among the most marginal laborers in New York City’s low-wage economy. Most are foreign-born, according to Carlos Encarnacion, an organizer with New York Communities for Change — often from the Dominican Republic, Central America and West Africa — and some unknowable number are undocumented, which makes them especially vulnerable to exploitation.Both the Attorney General’s office and the Department of Labor have investigated and recovered stolen wages in the carwash industry in recent years, and union organizers have been mobilizing carwash workers. But wage theft remains an endemic problem, and so far, only a few carwashes are unionized.For 15 years Martín Ureña was on the night shift at J.V. Car Wash in Inwood, which was known to the carwasheros as “Broadway.” The work was grueling and sometimes hazardous. The winters were the worst. When he got home at the end of his shift, he would soak in a hot bath. “I was in pain from the cold.”Juan Remigio Licona remembered a day at the Bronx location that he was told to clean out the underground pit where sludge and chemicals collect. “The smell was so strong, I was feeling dizzy,” Mr. Licona said through an interpreter. The manager insisted he finish the job.“You come from a poor country, you have dreams,” said Aldo Sención, who was born in the Dominican Republic. “But you never think that this reality could hit you so hard.”José Vázquez came to the United States from Cuba at age 12. He didn’t finish high school, but he saved his money and with his father bought a gas station in Inwood in the 1986, which became J.V. Car Wash (though it was known simply as Broadway.) Eventually he bought three more carwashes: one in Harlem, one in the Bronx and one in Elizabeth, N.J.Mr. Vázquez did not respond to requests for an interview, but Ofelia Sanchez, his girlfriend of 30 years, said that the carwash employees were not exploited. “We are immigrants ourselves,” she said in a lengthy phone interview. “We treated them like family.” The workers’ claims that they had been underpaid, she said, were lies. He may have had “a different way of doing things,” Ms. Sanchez said, but “José Vázquez is not a crook.”He was certainly successful. Sometimes Mr. Vázquez would drive up in his red Ferrari or his Rolls-Royce, and the workers would wash it for him. None of the workers interviewed for this article could recall him ever leaving a tip.Mr. Vázquez’s crews were nevertheless considered tipped workers. Like bartenders and waiters, manicurists and hair stylists, dog groomers and parking valets, the carwasheros depend on the generosity of customers to make a living. All these workers toil in industries that can legally pay employees according to a subminimum “tipped wage” scale. Gratuities from customers are supposed to make up the difference, but if tips are scarce, the employer is legally obliged to top up their pay envelopes to the standard minimum.But for some tipped workers, it doesn’t work out that way. Carwash managers frequently help themselves to a portion of the tips, according to testimony at New York Labor Department hearings last summer. One worker testified that if the giant automatic brushes damaged a windshield wiper or a mirror, his boss would reach into the tip jar to compensate the customer.At the Vázquez carwashes, workers had no notion of what their base wage might be, and whether the tips were actually coming to them. The managers would simply collect the money from the tip boxes at the end of each shift, take it into the office, and then hand the workers their wages in cash.“You don’t know if the customers gave more tips or less tips,” said Josué Gómez, who worked at Broadway for nearly nine years. “They gave us an envelope, and we had to take whatever is inside.”The workers were not alone in their confusion. The tipped wage is so complicated — with several different wage scales, depending on how plentiful tips are — that even scrupulous employers may find it hard to determine what they owe. That complexity also makes it difficult to sort out if workers are getting swindled.“I have many years of experience analyzing wage theft,” said Deborah L. Axt, co-executive director at Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization. But the payroll records for tipped workers are often bewildering. “It’s virtually impossible to detect and enforce wage theft with a system where employers are allowed to count tips toward the minimum wage,” she said.For years, the carwasheros took their pay envelopes with little complaint, and payment practices at the carwashes escaped scrutiny.Without an army of government investigators deployed in every workplace, enforcement of wage laws depends to some extent on employees to report violations. But immigrant workers are both more likely to be cheated and also less likely to come forward with their grievances. They may fear retaliation from a boss, they may hesitate to contact a government agency and they may not know how to find a private lawyer who would take an interest in their troubles.Steven Arenson, a lawyer with Arenson, Dittmar & Karban, takes an interest in workers’ troubles. Mr. Arenson taught constitutional law at Yale College, and now represents employees who believe they have been underpaid, discriminated against, or harassed on the job. In musing about his career path, Mr. Arenson, who wears glasses and a yarmulke, quoted a medieval Talmudic scholar on the Torah’s prohibition against cheating a hired laborer. He is a familiar figure in certain Latino immigrant circles, and that is how, in late 2010, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino arrived at his Madison Avenue office with their tale of stolen wages.The minimum wage in New York City at the time was $7.25 an hour. Working 72 hours a week, they should have been paid $638, including time and a half for every hour after 40 hours. But the carwasheros received around $300 each week.Colleagues advised him not to get involved. “They told me it was a quixotic fool’s errand,” he recalled, and that he’d never recover enough from a small operation like a carwash to make it worth his time.But Mr. Arenson listened as they talked about working outdoors all day in the cold, with wet hands and feet, making sweatshop wages. “The exploitation was so extreme,” Mr. Arenson recalled. “I thought it was outrageous.” He agreed to take the case.And so began a seven-year battle that turned out to be anything but a routine wage-and-hour case. After Mr. Vázquez learned about the suit, he fired all the plaintiffs who were still employed at his carwashes. He then declared in court conferences that none of the men had ever worked for him. He said they were “squatters,” “delinquents,” and “agents of drug lords,” who had usurped his businesses and kept the money for themselves. He accused them of criminal witness tampering.Mr. Vázquez refused to testify, failed to show up for depositions, fired his lawyers on the eve of a rescheduled deposition, asked to have the case dismissed and then, two years on, half an hour before he was once again scheduled to be deposed, he filed for bankruptcy protection.It looked as though Mr. Arenson’s colleagues had been right; it seemed the carwasheros would never collect their stolen wages. “The hope is that they are going to wear you down,” Mr. Arenson said. “You’ll accept some very small offer of a settlement and go away. And often it works.”That’s not what happened. Indeed, the Chapter 11 filing was a grievous tactical error. Ordinarily bankruptcy protection halts all litigation, but Mr. Arenson persuaded the bankruptcy judge that his clients deserved their day in court, and the case was allowed to proceed. Worse yet for Mr. Vázquez’s prospects, when he failed to comply with the bankruptcy court’s instructions, the judge appointed two trustees, Donald Biase and Donald Conway, to manage his business and personal affairs.As Mr. Biase sorted through the carwashes’ finances, he discovered that the accounts for the all-cash operations were “essentially nonexistent.” The payroll tax records listed just four employees for four carwashes: Mr. Vázquez himself, his girlfriend, his brother, and his octogenarian father. “Obviously,” Mr. Biase concluded, “these payroll tax returns were works of fiction.”The trustees also discovered, hidden in a safe in Mr. Vázquez’s basement, a stash of nearly $1.3 million in cash that he had not disclosed. “I can say this,” Mr. Arenson said. “José Vázquez never failed to surprise us.”The trustees concluded that there was no defense Mr. Vázquez could make at trial, and in December 2014 the lawsuit was settled. The men who had labored the longest at the carwashes received close to $200,000 each. Together, the 18 workers received $1.65 million.But that was not the end of it. For months Mr. Arenson had been turning away employees of Mr. Vázquez’s businesses who had hoped to join the suit; the court’s deadline for submitting claims had long since expired. But Mr. Biase had been operating the carwashes (and paying a legal wage), and he understood that there were dozens more workers who might also have valid claims. He asked the court to allow more plaintiffs.In the next few months, 88 more workers signed on. This is where a lot of cases would fold: with so many claims, some going back a decade or more, it seemed likely there would be no money to share. But it turned out that Mr. Vázquez owned not just the carwash businesses but also three of the four plots of land beneath them, including one property in a rapidly gentrifying corner of Harlem. Together the three parcels were sold for more than $30 million. A seven-story condominium is being built on the lot where the Harlem carwash once stood.In December, five days before Christmas, the second group of plaintiffs received their settlement checks, ranging from a few thousand dollars to more than $90,000. Once the final payments are released this summer, the total settlement for all 106 workers, in both groups — including their attorney fees and expenses, which the judge ordered would be paid by Mr. Vázquez — will be roughly $8.5 million.On a day when he suddenly had money for more than the bare necessities, Manuel Mercado talked about his old job as a car washer. “One of the managers, I never will forget, we had an argument, and he said, ‘You’re a nobody, you don’t even have papers.’” Mr. Mercado now owns a small restaurant in Brooklyn and plans to put some of his settlement money into his new business. But his big dream, he said, “is to be able to go to college and get a degree in this country.”Martín Ureña’s first luxury would be buying Christmas presents for his wife and daughters. In the spring, the family will move back to the Dominican Republic. Josué Gómez would like to buy a house outside the city, to save for his daughters, and to send something to his family in the Dominican Republic. Juan Remigio Licona wants to help his children in Mexico, and simply “to live better than I did before.”But when explaining why they sued their employer, the workers didn’t talk about the money. They wanted to be treated fairly, Henry Paulino said. They did it “to make justice.”AdvertisementWage-theft cases are notoriously hard to prove, and they almost never pay out. But for some of the most marginalized laborers in the city, justice was served.Juan Remigio Licona at the site of J.V.

After Mr. Vázquez learned about the suit, he fired all the plaintiffs who were still employed at his carwashes. He then declared in court conferences that none of the men had ever worked for him. He said they were “squatters,” “delinquents,” and “agents of drug lords,” who had usurped his businesses and kept the money for themselves. He accused them of criminal witness tampering.Mr. Vázquez refused to testify, failed to show up for depositions, fired his lawyers on the eve of a rescheduled deposition, asked to have the case dismissed and then, two years on, half an hour before he was once again scheduled to be deposed, he filed for bankruptcy protection.It looked as though Mr. Arenson’s colleagues had been right; it seemed the carwasheros would never collect their stolen wages. “The hope is that they are going to wear you down,” Mr. Arenson said. “You’ll accept some very small offer of a settlement and go away. And often it works.”That’s not what happened. Indeed, the Chapter 11 filing was a grievous tactical error. Ordinarily bankruptcy protection halts all litigation, but Mr. Arenson persuaded the bankruptcy judge that his clients deserved their day in court, and the case was allowed to proceed. Worse yet for Mr. Vázquez’s prospects, when he failed to comply with the bankruptcy court’s instructions, the judge appointed two trustees, Donald Biase and Donald Conway, to manage his business and personal affairs.As Mr. Biase sorted through the carwashes’ finances, he discovered that the accounts for the all-cash operations were “essentially nonexistent.” The payroll tax records listed just four employees for four carwashes: Mr. Vázquez himself, his girlfriend, his brother, and his octogenarian father. “Obviously,” Mr. Biase concluded, “these payroll tax returns were works of fiction.”The trustees also discovered, hidden in a safe in Mr. Vázquez’s basement, a stash of nearly $1.3 million in cash that he had not disclosed. “I can say this,” Mr. Arenson said. “José Vázquez never failed to surprise us.”The trustees concluded that there was no defense Mr. Vázquez could make at trial, and in December 2014 the lawsuit was settled. The men who had labored the longest at the carwashes received close to $200,000 each. Together, the 18 workers received $1.65 million.But that was not the end of it. For months Mr. Arenson had been turning away employees of Mr. Vázquez’s businesses who had hoped to join the suit; the court’s deadline for submitting claims had long since expired. But Mr. Biase had been operating the carwashes (and paying a legal wage), and he understood that there were dozens more workers who might also have valid claims. He asked the court to allow more plaintiffs.In the next few months, 88 more workers signed on. This is where a lot of cases would fold: with so many claims, some going back a decade or more, it seemed likely there would be no money to share. But it turned out that Mr. Vázquez owned not just the carwash businesses but also three of the four plots of land beneath them, including one property in a rapidly gentrifying corner of Harlem. Together the three parcels were sold for more than $30 million. A seven-story condominium is being built on the lot where the Harlem carwash once stood.In December, five days before Christmas, the second group of plaintiffs received their settlement checks, ranging from a few thousand dollars to more than $90,000. Once the final payments are released this summer, the total settlement for all 106 workers, in both groups — including their attorney fees and expenses, which the judge ordered would be paid by Mr. Vázquez — will be roughly $8.5 million.On a day when he suddenly had money for more than the bare necessities, Manuel Mercado talked about his old job as a car washer. “One of the managers, I never will forget, we had an argument, and he said, ‘You’re a nobody, you don’t even have papers.’” Mr. Mercado now owns a small restaurant in Brooklyn and plans to put some of his settlement money into his new business. But his big dream, he said, “is to be able to go to college and get a degree in this country.”Martín Ureña’s first luxury would be buying Christmas presents for his wife and daughters. In the spring, the family will move back to the Dominican Republic. Josué Gómez would like to buy a house outside the city, to save for his daughters, and to send something to his family in the Dominican Republic. Juan Remigio Licona wants to help his children in Mexico, and simply “to live better than I did before.”But when explaining why they sued their employer, the workers didn’t talk about the money. They wanted to be treated fairly, Henry Paulino said. They did it “to make justice.”AdvertisementWage-theft cases are notoriously hard to prove, and they almost never pay out. But for some of the most marginalized laborers in the city, justice was served.Juan Remigio Licona at the site of J.V. Car Wash, in Inwood, where he used to work.CreditCreditSarah Blesener for The New York TimesSupported byBy Tracy Tullis[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Before J.V. Car Wash closed for good, it was open all the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Workers put in 12-hour shifts, sponging, drying, and waxing the cars, cleaning the wheels, and vacuuming the interiors, six or even seven days a week.They worked in frigid and searing weather, were expected to use harsh chemical cleaners without gloves, and endured abuse if they took a few minutes to rest.For all this, the employees were paid about $50 a day, roughly $4 an hour. Complaints about low wages were ignored. “The manager would say, ‘If you want to work, then work,’” Juan Remigio Licona said in Spanish. “‘If you don’t want to work, you can go.’”Two workers, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino, had logged eight years between them at the carwash when they concluded they did not want to work under those conditions and sought the advice of a lawyer. Both were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who had an imperfect command of English and an imperfect understanding of their rights under U.S. labor law. But in 2011, against long odds, they filed suit against their employer, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor law.The case against J.V. Car Wash (and its sister locations) took some unusual turns, as the carwash owner, José Vázquez, contrived a series of bizarre claims to undermine the workers’ lawsuit. But the really surprising twist to this unlikely story: the carwasheros, as they call themselves, won. By the time the last checks are disbursed this summer, almost eight years after the suit was filed, the 106 workers who eventually signed on as plaintiffs will have received a share of roughly $8.5 million — a spectacular sum for a wage theft case.The average plaintiff award in a wage theft case is less than $6,000, according to Samuel Estreicher, a professor at New York University Law School and director of the school’s Center for Labor and Employment Law. These carwasheros won an average of more than $80,000 per worker.Carwash workers are among the most marginal laborers in New York City’s low-wage economy. Most are foreign-born, according to Carlos Encarnacion, an organizer with New York Communities for Change — often from the Dominican Republic, Central America and West Africa — and some unknowable number are undocumented, which makes them especially vulnerable to exploitation.Both the Attorney General’s office and the Department of Labor have investigated and recovered stolen wages in the carwash industry in recent years, and union organizers have been mobilizing carwash workers. But wage theft remains an endemic problem, and so far, only a few carwashes are unionized.For 15 years Martín Ureña was on the night shift at J.V. Car Wash in Inwood, which was known to the carwasheros as “Broadway.” The work was grueling and sometimes hazardous. The winters were the worst. When he got home at the end of his shift, he would soak in a hot bath. “I was in pain from the cold.”Juan Remigio Licona remembered a day at the Bronx location that he was told to clean out the underground pit where sludge and chemicals collect. “The smell was so strong, I was feeling dizzy,” Mr. Licona said through an interpreter. The manager insisted he finish the job.“You come from a poor country, you have dreams,” said Aldo Sención, who was born in the Dominican Republic. “But you never think that this reality could hit you so hard.”José Vázquez came to the United States from Cuba at age 12. He didn’t finish high school, but he saved his money and with his father bought a gas station in Inwood in the 1986, which became J.V. Car Wash (though it was known simply as Broadway.) Eventually he bought three more carwashes: one in Harlem, one in the Bronx and one in Elizabeth, N.J.Mr. Vázquez did not respond to requests for an interview, but Ofelia Sanchez, his girlfriend of 30 years, said that the carwash employees were not exploited. “We are immigrants ourselves,” she said in a lengthy phone interview. “We treated them like family.” The workers’ claims that they had been underpaid, she said, were lies. He may have had “a different way of doing things,” Ms. Sanchez said, but “José Vázquez is not a crook.”He was certainly successful. Sometimes Mr. Vázquez would drive up in his red Ferrari or his Rolls-Royce, and the workers would wash it for him. None of the workers interviewed for this article could recall him ever leaving a tip.Mr. Vázquez’s crews were nevertheless considered tipped workers. Like bartenders and waiters, manicurists and hair stylists, dog groomers and parking valets, the carwasheros depend on the generosity of customers to make a living. All these workers toil in industries that can legally pay employees according to a subminimum “tipped wage” scale. Gratuities from customers are supposed to make up the difference, but if tips are scarce, the employer is legally obliged to top up their pay envelopes to the standard minimum.But for some tipped workers, it doesn’t work out that way. Carwash managers frequently help themselves to a portion of the tips, according to testimony at New York Labor Department hearings last summer. One worker testified that if the giant automatic brushes damaged a windshield wiper or a mirror, his boss would reach into the tip jar to compensate the customer.At the Vázquez carwashes, workers had no notion of what their base wage might be, and whether the tips were actually coming to them. The managers would simply collect the money from the tip boxes at the end of each shift, take it into the office, and then hand the workers their wages in cash.“You don’t know if the customers gave more tips or less tips,” said Josué Gómez, who worked at Broadway for nearly nine years. “They gave us an envelope, and we had to take whatever is inside.”The workers were not alone in their confusion. The tipped wage is so complicated — with several different wage scales, depending on how plentiful tips are — that even scrupulous employers may find it hard to determine what they owe. That complexity also makes it difficult to sort out if workers are getting swindled.“I have many years of experience analyzing wage theft,” said Deborah L. Axt, co-executive director at Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization. But the payroll records for tipped workers are often bewildering. “It’s virtually impossible to detect and enforce wage theft with a system where employers are allowed to count tips toward the minimum wage,” she said.For years, the carwasheros took their pay envelopes with little complaint, and payment practices at the carwashes escaped scrutiny.Without an army of government investigators deployed in every workplace, enforcement of wage laws depends to some extent on employees to report violations. But immigrant workers are both more likely to be cheated and also less likely to come forward with their grievances. They may fear retaliation from a boss, they may hesitate to contact a government agency and they may not know how to find a private lawyer who would take an interest in their troubles.Steven Arenson, a lawyer with Arenson, Dittmar & Karban, takes an interest in workers’ troubles. Mr. Arenson taught constitutional law at Yale College, and now represents employees who believe they have been underpaid, discriminated against, or harassed on the job. In musing about his career path, Mr. Arenson, who wears glasses and a yarmulke, quoted a medieval Talmudic scholar on the Torah’s prohibition against cheating a hired laborer. He is a familiar figure in certain Latino immigrant circles, and that is how, in late 2010, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino arrived at his Madison Avenue office with their tale of stolen wages.The minimum wage in New York City at the time was $7.25 an hour. Working 72 hours a week, they should have been paid $638, including time and a half for every hour after 40 hours. But the carwasheros received around $300 each week.Colleagues advised him not to get involved. “They told me it was a quixotic fool’s errand,” he recalled, and that he’d never recover enough from a small operation like a carwash to make it worth his time.But Mr. Arenson listened as they talked about working outdoors all day in the cold, with wet hands and feet, making sweatshop wages. “The exploitation was so extreme,” Mr. Arenson recalled. “I thought it was outrageous.” He agreed to take the case.And so began a seven-year battle that turned out to be anything but a routine wage-and-hour case. After Mr. Vázquez learned about the suit, he fired all the plaintiffs who were still employed at his carwashes. He then declared in court conferences that none of the men had ever worked for him. He said they were “squatters,” “delinquents,” and “agents of drug lords,” who had usurped his businesses and kept the money for themselves. He accused them of criminal witness tampering.Mr. Vázquez refused to testify, failed to show up for depositions, fired his lawyers on the eve of a rescheduled deposition, asked to have the case dismissed and then, two years on, half an hour before he was once again scheduled to be deposed, he filed for bankruptcy protection.It looked as though Mr. Arenson’s colleagues had been right; it seemed the carwasheros would never collect their stolen wages. “The hope is that they are going to wear you down,” Mr. Arenson said. “You’ll accept some very small offer of a settlement and go away.

Most are foreign-born, according to Carlos Encarnacion, an organizer with New York Communities for Change — often from the Dominican Republic, Central America and West Africa — and some unknowable number are undocumented, which makes them especially vulnerable to exploitation.Both the Attorney General’s office and the Department of Labor have investigated and recovered stolen wages in the carwash industry in recent years, and union organizers have been mobilizing carwash workers. But wage theft remains an endemic problem, and so far, only a few carwashes are unionized.For 15 years Martín Ureña was on the night shift at J.V. Car Wash in Inwood, which was known to the carwasheros as “Broadway.” The work was grueling and sometimes hazardous. The winters were the worst. When he got home at the end of his shift, he would soak in a hot bath. “I was in pain from the cold.”Juan Remigio Licona remembered a day at the Bronx location that he was told to clean out the underground pit where sludge and chemicals collect. “The smell was so strong, I was feeling dizzy,” Mr. Licona said through an interpreter. The manager insisted he finish the job.“You come from a poor country, you have dreams,” said Aldo Sención, who was born in the Dominican Republic. “But you never think that this reality could hit you so hard.”José Vázquez came to the United States from Cuba at age 12. He didn’t finish high school, but he saved his money and with his father bought a gas station in Inwood in the 1986, which became J.V. Car Wash (though it was known simply as Broadway.) Eventually he bought three more carwashes: one in Harlem, one in the Bronx and one in Elizabeth, N.J.Mr. Vázquez did not respond to requests for an interview, but Ofelia Sanchez, his girlfriend of 30 years, said that the carwash employees were not exploited. “We are immigrants ourselves,” she said in a lengthy phone interview. “We treated them like family.” The workers’ claims that they had been underpaid, she said, were lies. He may have had “a different way of doing things,” Ms. Sanchez said, but “José Vázquez is not a crook.”He was certainly successful. Sometimes Mr. Vázquez would drive up in his red Ferrari or his Rolls-Royce, and the workers would wash it for him. None of the workers interviewed for this article could recall him ever leaving a tip.Mr. Vázquez’s crews were nevertheless considered tipped workers. Like bartenders and waiters, manicurists and hair stylists, dog groomers and parking valets, the carwasheros depend on the generosity of customers to make a living. All these workers toil in industries that can legally pay employees according to a subminimum “tipped wage” scale. Gratuities from customers are supposed to make up the difference, but if tips are scarce, the employer is legally obliged to top up their pay envelopes to the standard minimum.But for some tipped workers, it doesn’t work out that way. Carwash managers frequently help themselves to a portion of the tips, according to testimony at New York Labor Department hearings last summer. One worker testified that if the giant automatic brushes damaged a windshield wiper or a mirror, his boss would reach into the tip jar to compensate the customer.At the Vázquez carwashes, workers had no notion of what their base wage might be, and whether the tips were actually coming to them. The managers would simply collect the money from the tip boxes at the end of each shift, take it into the office, and then hand the workers their wages in cash.“You don’t know if the customers gave more tips or less tips,” said Josué Gómez, who worked at Broadway for nearly nine years. “They gave us an envelope, and we had to take whatever is inside.”The workers were not alone in their confusion. The tipped wage is so complicated — with several different wage scales, depending on how plentiful tips are — that even scrupulous employers may find it hard to determine what they owe. That complexity also makes it difficult to sort out if workers are getting swindled.“I have many years of experience analyzing wage theft,” said Deborah L. Axt, co-executive director at Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization. But the payroll records for tipped workers are often bewildering. “It’s virtually impossible to detect and enforce wage theft with a system where employers are allowed to count tips toward the minimum wage,” she said.For years, the carwasheros took their pay envelopes with little complaint, and payment practices at the carwashes escaped scrutiny.Without an army of government investigators deployed in every workplace, enforcement of wage laws depends to some extent on employees to report violations. But immigrant workers are both more likely to be cheated and also less likely to come forward with their grievances. They may fear retaliation from a boss, they may hesitate to contact a government agency and they may not know how to find a private lawyer who would take an interest in their troubles.Steven Arenson, a lawyer with Arenson, Dittmar & Karban, takes an interest in workers’ troubles. Mr. Arenson taught constitutional law at Yale College, and now represents employees who believe they have been underpaid, discriminated against, or harassed on the job. In musing about his career path, Mr. Arenson, who wears glasses and a yarmulke, quoted a medieval Talmudic scholar on the Torah’s prohibition against cheating a hired laborer. He is a familiar figure in certain Latino immigrant circles, and that is how, in late 2010, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino arrived at his Madison Avenue office with their tale of stolen wages.The minimum wage in New York City at the time was $7.25 an hour. Working 72 hours a week, they should have been paid $638, including time and a half for every hour after 40 hours. But the carwasheros received around $300 each week.Colleagues advised him not to get involved. “They told me it was a quixotic fool’s errand,” he recalled, and that he’d never recover enough from a small operation like a carwash to make it worth his time.But Mr. Arenson listened as they talked about working outdoors all day in the cold, with wet hands and feet, making sweatshop wages. “The exploitation was so extreme,” Mr. Arenson recalled. “I thought it was outrageous.” He agreed to take the case.And so began a seven-year battle that turned out to be anything but a routine wage-and-hour case. After Mr. Vázquez learned about the suit, he fired all the plaintiffs who were still employed at his carwashes. He then declared in court conferences that none of the men had ever worked for him. He said they were “squatters,” “delinquents,” and “agents of drug lords,” who had usurped his businesses and kept the money for themselves. He accused them of criminal witness tampering.Mr. Vázquez refused to testify, failed to show up for depositions, fired his lawyers on the eve of a rescheduled deposition, asked to have the case dismissed and then, two years on, half an hour before he was once again scheduled to be deposed, he filed for bankruptcy protection.It looked as though Mr. Arenson’s colleagues had been right; it seemed the carwasheros would never collect their stolen wages. “The hope is that they are going to wear you down,” Mr. Arenson said. “You’ll accept some very small offer of a settlement and go away. And often it works.”That’s not what happened. Indeed, the Chapter 11 filing was a grievous tactical error. Ordinarily bankruptcy protection halts all litigation, but Mr. Arenson persuaded the bankruptcy judge that his clients deserved their day in court, and the case was allowed to proceed. Worse yet for Mr. Vázquez’s prospects, when he failed to comply with the bankruptcy court’s instructions, the judge appointed two trustees, Donald Biase and Donald Conway, to manage his business and personal affairs.As Mr. Biase sorted through the carwashes’ finances, he discovered that the accounts for the all-cash operations were “essentially nonexistent.” The payroll tax records listed just four employees for four carwashes: Mr. Vázquez himself, his girlfriend, his brother, and his octogenarian father. “Obviously,” Mr. Biase concluded, “these payroll tax returns were works of fiction.”The trustees also discovered, hidden in a safe in Mr. Vázquez’s basement, a stash of nearly $1.3 million in cash that he had not disclosed. “I can say this,” Mr. Arenson said. “José Vázquez never failed to surprise us.”The trustees concluded that there was no defense Mr. Vázquez could make at trial, and in December 2014 the lawsuit was settled. The men who had labored the longest at the carwashes received close to $200,000 each. Together, the 18 workers received $1.65 million.But that was not the end of it. For months Mr. Arenson had been turning away employees of Mr. Vázquez’s businesses who had hoped to join the suit; the court’s deadline for submitting claims had long since expired. But Mr. Biase had been operating the carwashes (and paying a legal wage), and he understood that there were dozens more workers who might also have valid claims. He asked the court to allow more plaintiffs.In the next few months, 88 more workers signed on. This is where a lot of cases would fold: with so many claims, some going back a decade or more, it seemed likely there would be no money to share. But it turned out that Mr. Vázquez owned not just the carwash businesses but also three of the four plots of land beneath them, including one property in a rapidly gentrifying corner of Harlem. Together the three parcels were sold for more than $30 million. A seven-story condominium is being built on the lot where the Harlem carwash once stood.In December, five days before Christmas, the second group of plaintiffs received their settlement checks, ranging from a few thousand dollars to more than $90,000. Once the final payments are released this summer, the total settlement for all 106 workers, in both groups — including their attorney fees and expenses, which the judge ordered would be paid by Mr. Vázquez — will be roughly $8.5 million.On a day when he suddenly had money for more than the bare necessities, Manuel Mercado talked about his old job as a car washer. “One of the managers, I never will forget, we had an argument, and he said, ‘You’re a nobody, you don’t even have papers.’” Mr. Mercado now owns a small restaurant in Brooklyn and plans to put some of his settlement money into his new business. But his big dream, he said, “is to be able to go to college and get a degree in this country.”Martín Ureña’s first luxury would be buying Christmas presents for his wife and daughters. In the spring, the family will move back to the Dominican Republic. Josué Gómez would like to buy a house outside the city, to save for his daughters, and to send something to his family in the Dominican Republic. Juan Remigio Licona wants to help his children in Mexico, and simply “to live better than I did before.”But when explaining why they sued their employer, the workers didn’t talk about the money. They wanted to be treated fairly, Henry Paulino said. They did it “to make justice.”AdvertisementWage-theft cases are notoriously hard to prove, and they almost never pay out. But for some of the most marginalized laborers in the city, justice was served.Juan Remigio Licona at the site of J.V. Car Wash, in Inwood, where he used to work.CreditCreditSarah Blesener for The New York TimesSupported byBy Tracy Tullis[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Before J.V. Car Wash closed for good, it was open all the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Workers put in 12-hour shifts, sponging, drying, and waxing the cars, cleaning the wheels, and vacuuming the interiors, six or even seven days a week.They worked in frigid and searing weather, were expected to use harsh chemical cleaners without gloves, and endured abuse if they took a few minutes to rest.For all this, the employees were paid about $50 a day, roughly $4 an hour. Complaints about low wages were ignored. “The manager would say, ‘If you want to work, then work,’” Juan Remigio Licona said in Spanish. “‘If you don’t want to work, you can go.’”Two workers, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino, had logged eight years between them at the carwash when they concluded they did not want to work under those conditions and sought the advice of a lawyer. Both were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who had an imperfect command of English and an imperfect understanding of their rights under U.S. labor law. But in 2011, against long odds, they filed suit against their employer, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor law.The case against J.V. Car Wash (and its sister locations) took some unusual turns, as the carwash owner, José Vázquez, contrived a series of bizarre claims to undermine the workers’ lawsuit. But the really surprising twist to this unlikely story: the carwasheros, as they call themselves, won. By the time the last checks are disbursed this summer, almost eight years after the suit was filed, the 106 workers who eventually signed on as plaintiffs will have received a share of roughly $8.5 million — a spectacular sum for a wage theft case.The average plaintiff award in a wage theft case is less than $6,000, according to Samuel Estreicher, a professor at New York University Law School and director of the school’s Center for Labor and Employment Law.

Worse yet for Mr. Vázquez’s prospects, when he failed to comply with the bankruptcy court’s instructions, the judge appointed two trustees, Donald Biase and Donald Conway, to manage his business and personal affairs.As Mr. Biase sorted through the carwashes’ finances, he discovered that the accounts for the all-cash operations were “essentially nonexistent.” The payroll tax records listed just four employees for four carwashes: Mr. Vázquez himself, his girlfriend, his brother, and his octogenarian father. “Obviously,” Mr. Biase concluded, “these payroll tax returns were works of fiction.”The trustees also discovered, hidden in a safe in Mr. Vázquez’s basement, a stash of nearly $1.3 million in cash that he had not disclosed. “I can say this,” Mr. Arenson said. “José Vázquez never failed to surprise us.”The trustees concluded that there was no defense Mr. Vázquez could make at trial, and in December 2014 the lawsuit was settled. The men who had labored the longest at the carwashes received close to $200,000 each. Together, the 18 workers received $1.65 million.But that was not the end of it. For months Mr. Arenson had been turning away employees of Mr. Vázquez’s businesses who had hoped to join the suit; the court’s deadline for submitting claims had long since expired. But Mr. Biase had been operating the carwashes (and paying a legal wage), and he understood that there were dozens more workers who might also have valid claims. He asked the court to allow more plaintiffs.In the next few months, 88 more workers signed on. This is where a lot of cases would fold: with so many claims, some going back a decade or more, it seemed likely there would be no money to share. But it turned out that Mr. Vázquez owned not just the carwash businesses but also three of the four plots of land beneath them, including one property in a rapidly gentrifying corner of Harlem. Together the three parcels were sold for more than $30 million. A seven-story condominium is being built on the lot where the Harlem carwash once stood.In December, five days before Christmas, the second group of plaintiffs received their settlement checks, ranging from a few thousand dollars to more than $90,000. Once the final payments are released this summer, the total settlement for all 106 workers, in both groups — including their attorney fees and expenses, which the judge ordered would be paid by Mr. Vázquez — will be roughly $8.5 million.On a day when he suddenly had money for more than the bare necessities, Manuel Mercado talked about his old job as a car washer. “One of the managers, I never will forget, we had an argument, and he said, ‘You’re a nobody, you don’t even have papers.’” Mr. Mercado now owns a small restaurant in Brooklyn and plans to put some of his settlement money into his new business. But his big dream, he said, “is to be able to go to college and get a degree in this country.”Martín Ureña’s first luxury would be buying Christmas presents for his wife and daughters. In the spring, the family will move back to the Dominican Republic. Josué Gómez would like to buy a house outside the city, to save for his daughters, and to send something to his family in the Dominican Republic. Juan Remigio Licona wants to help his children in Mexico, and simply “to live better than I did before.”But when explaining why they sued their employer, the workers didn’t talk about the money. They wanted to be treated fairly, Henry Paulino said. They did it “to make justice.”AdvertisementWage-theft cases are notoriously hard to prove, and they almost never pay out. But for some of the most marginalized laborers in the city, justice was served.Juan Remigio Licona at the site of J.V. Car Wash, in Inwood, where he used to work.CreditCreditSarah Blesener for The New York TimesSupported byBy Tracy Tullis[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Before J.V. Car Wash closed for good, it was open all the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Workers put in 12-hour shifts, sponging, drying, and waxing the cars, cleaning the wheels, and vacuuming the interiors, six or even seven days a week.They worked in frigid and searing weather, were expected to use harsh chemical cleaners without gloves, and endured abuse if they took a few minutes to rest.For all this, the employees were paid about $50 a day, roughly $4 an hour. Complaints about low wages were ignored. “The manager would say, ‘If you want to work, then work,’” Juan Remigio Licona said in Spanish. “‘If you don’t want to work, you can go.’”Two workers, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino, had logged eight years between them at the carwash when they concluded they did not want to work under those conditions and sought the advice of a lawyer. Both were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who had an imperfect command of English and an imperfect understanding of their rights under U.S. labor law. But in 2011, against long odds, they filed suit against their employer, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor law.The case against J.V. Car Wash (and its sister locations) took some unusual turns, as the carwash owner, José Vázquez, contrived a series of bizarre claims to undermine the workers’ lawsuit. But the really surprising twist to this unlikely story: the carwasheros, as they call themselves, won. By the time the last checks are disbursed this summer, almost eight years after the suit was filed, the 106 workers who eventually signed on as plaintiffs will have received a share of roughly $8.5 million — a spectacular sum for a wage theft case.The average plaintiff award in a wage theft case is less than $6,000, according to Samuel Estreicher, a professor at New York University Law School and director of the school’s Center for Labor and Employment Law. These carwasheros won an average of more than $80,000 per worker.Carwash workers are among the most marginal laborers in New York City’s low-wage economy. Most are foreign-born, according to Carlos Encarnacion, an organizer with New York Communities for Change — often from the Dominican Republic, Central America and West Africa — and some unknowable number are undocumented, which makes them especially vulnerable to exploitation.Both the Attorney General’s office and the Department of Labor have investigated and recovered stolen wages in the carwash industry in recent years, and union organizers have been mobilizing carwash workers. But wage theft remains an endemic problem, and so far, only a few carwashes are unionized.For 15 years Martín Ureña was on the night shift at J.V. Car Wash in Inwood, which was known to the carwasheros as “Broadway.” The work was grueling and sometimes hazardous. The winters were the worst. When he got home at the end of his shift, he would soak in a hot bath. “I was in pain from the cold.”Juan Remigio Licona remembered a day at the Bronx location that he was told to clean out the underground pit where sludge and chemicals collect. “The smell was so strong, I was feeling dizzy,” Mr. Licona said through an interpreter. The manager insisted he finish the job.“You come from a poor country, you have dreams,” said Aldo Sención, who was born in the Dominican Republic. “But you never think that this reality could hit you so hard.”José Vázquez came to the United States from Cuba at age 12. He didn’t finish high school, but he saved his money and with his father bought a gas station in Inwood in the 1986, which became J.V. Car Wash (though it was known simply as Broadway.) Eventually he bought three more carwashes: one in Harlem, one in the Bronx and one in Elizabeth, N.J.Mr. Vázquez did not respond to requests for an interview, but Ofelia Sanchez, his girlfriend of 30 years, said that the carwash employees were not exploited. “We are immigrants ourselves,” she said in a lengthy phone interview. “We treated them like family.” The workers’ claims that they had been underpaid, she said, were lies. He may have had “a different way of doing things,” Ms. Sanchez said, but “José Vázquez is not a crook.”He was certainly successful. Sometimes Mr. Vázquez would drive up in his red Ferrari or his Rolls-Royce, and the workers would wash it for him. None of the workers interviewed for this article could recall him ever leaving a tip.Mr. Vázquez’s crews were nevertheless considered tipped workers. Like bartenders and waiters, manicurists and hair stylists, dog groomers and parking valets, the carwasheros depend on the generosity of customers to make a living. All these workers toil in industries that can legally pay employees according to a subminimum “tipped wage” scale. Gratuities from customers are supposed to make up the difference, but if tips are scarce, the employer is legally obliged to top up their pay envelopes to the standard minimum.But for some tipped workers, it doesn’t work out that way. Carwash managers frequently help themselves to a portion of the tips, according to testimony at New York Labor Department hearings last summer. One worker testified that if the giant automatic brushes damaged a windshield wiper or a mirror, his boss would reach into the tip jar to compensate the customer.At the Vázquez carwashes, workers had no notion of what their base wage might be, and whether the tips were actually coming to them. The managers would simply collect the money from the tip boxes at the end of each shift, take it into the office, and then hand the workers their wages in cash.“You don’t know if the customers gave more tips or less tips,” said Josué Gómez, who worked at Broadway for nearly nine years. “They gave us an envelope, and we had to take whatever is inside.”The workers were not alone in their confusion. The tipped wage is so complicated — with several different wage scales, depending on how plentiful tips are — that even scrupulous employers may find it hard to determine what they owe. That complexity also makes it difficult to sort out if workers are getting swindled.“I have many years of experience analyzing wage theft,” said Deborah L. Axt, co-executive director at Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization. But the payroll records for tipped workers are often bewildering. “It’s virtually impossible to detect and enforce wage theft with a system where employers are allowed to count tips toward the minimum wage,” she said.For years, the carwasheros took their pay envelopes with little complaint, and payment practices at the carwashes escaped scrutiny.Without an army of government investigators deployed in every workplace, enforcement of wage laws depends to some extent on employees to report violations. But immigrant workers are both more likely to be cheated and also less likely to come forward with their grievances. They may fear retaliation from a boss, they may hesitate to contact a government agency and they may not know how to find a private lawyer who would take an interest in their troubles.Steven Arenson, a lawyer with Arenson, Dittmar & Karban, takes an interest in workers’ troubles. Mr. Arenson taught constitutional law at Yale College, and now represents employees who believe they have been underpaid, discriminated against, or harassed on the job. In musing about his career path, Mr. Arenson, who wears glasses and a yarmulke, quoted a medieval Talmudic scholar on the Torah’s prohibition against cheating a hired laborer. He is a familiar figure in certain Latino immigrant circles, and that is how, in late 2010, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino arrived at his Madison Avenue office with their tale of stolen wages.The minimum wage in New York City at the time was $7.25 an hour. Working 72 hours a week, they should have been paid $638, including time and a half for every hour after 40 hours. But the carwasheros received around $300 each week.Colleagues advised him not to get involved. “They told me it was a quixotic fool’s errand,” he recalled, and that he’d never recover enough from a small operation like a carwash to make it worth his time.But Mr. Arenson listened as they talked about working outdoors all day in the cold, with wet hands and feet, making sweatshop wages. “The exploitation was so extreme,” Mr. Arenson recalled. “I thought it was outrageous.” He agreed to take the case.And so began a seven-year battle that turned out to be anything but a routine wage-and-hour case. After Mr. Vázquez learned about the suit, he fired all the plaintiffs who were still employed at his carwashes. He then declared in court conferences that none of the men had ever worked for him. He said they were “squatters,” “delinquents,” and “agents of drug lords,” who had usurped his businesses and kept the money for themselves. He accused them of criminal witness tampering.Mr. Vázquez refused to testify, failed to show up for depositions, fired his lawyers on the eve of a rescheduled deposition, asked to have the case dismissed and then, two years on, half an hour before he was once again scheduled to be deposed, he filed for bankruptcy protection.It looked as though Mr. Arenson’s colleagues had been right; it seemed the carwasheros would never collect their stolen wages. “The hope is that they are going to wear you down,” Mr. Arenson said. “You’ll accept some very small offer of a settlement and go away. And often it works.”That’s not what happened. Indeed, the Chapter 11 filing was a grievous tactical error. Ordinarily bankruptcy protection halts all litigation, but Mr. Arenson persuaded the bankruptcy judge that his clients deserved their day in court, and the case was allowed to proceed. Worse yet for Mr. Vázquez’s prospects, when he failed to comply with the bankruptcy court’s instructions, the judge appointed two trustees, Donald Biase and Donald Conway, to manage his business and personal affairs.As Mr. Biase sorted through the carwashes’ finances, he discovered that the accounts for the all-cash operations were “essentially nonexistent.” The payroll tax records listed just four employees for four carwashes: Mr. Vázquez himself, his girlfriend, his brother, and his octogenarian father. “Obviously,” Mr. Biase concluded, “these payroll tax returns were works of fiction.”The trustees also discovered, hidden in a safe in Mr. Vázquez’s basement, a stash of nearly $1.3 million in cash that he had not disclosed. “I can say this,” Mr. Arenson said. “José Vázquez never failed to surprise us.”The trustees concluded that there was no defense Mr. Vázquez could make at trial, and in December 2014 the lawsuit was settled.

Now they could bring down the entire country.By Omar G. EncarnaciónMr. Encarnación is a professor and expert on Spanish politics.Anyone looking for evidence of how irrational politics can be should look to Catalonia right now.Earlier this month, Catalan separatists in the Spanish Parliament voted against the 2019 national budget proposal of the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, forcing a snap general election in late April. The separatists were retaliating against Mr. Sánchez because he would not agree to a referendum on Catalan independence. The last referendum, organized in October 2017, which was declared illegal by Spain’s Constitutional Tribunal and boycotted by those opposed to independence, plunged Spain into its deepest political crisis since the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975.In forcing early elections and the potential fall of the Sánchez government, which came to power in June following a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of the conservative Popular Party, the Catalan separatists appear willing to forfeit the best chance they have had in decades to advance Catalan autonomy. The Sánchez government has supported dialogue with Catalan separatists; appointed many Catalans to prominent cabinet positions, including Meritxell Batet, responsible for managing regional affairs; and agreed to a substantial increase in public spending in Catalonia for 2019. It even consented to talks about amending the Spanish Constitution to expand autonomy for all of Spain’s regions.Those gains could be quickly erased if the Popular Party is returned to power, something that the separatists were apparently aware of when they voted against the budget proposal. The newspaper El País reported that separatist leaders voted “with long faces” because they knew that they were most likely contributing to the rise of a new government that could reimpose direct control of Madrid over Catalonia as the Rajoy government did in 2017.Indeed, chances are that a new right-wing government in Madrid would be even more intolerant of Catalan separatism than Mr. Rajoy was. Since Mr. Rajoy’s departure from office, the Popular Party has hardened its stance on Catalan separatism, in no small measure because of the rise of Vox, a new far-right party that made a splash in regional elections in Andalusia in December, when it won 12 seats in the Andalusian Parliament on a platform that combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a hard line on the Catalonia crisis. Vox has gone as far as to call for abolishing altogether Spain’s system of regional autonomy and outlawing separatist political parties.Why would the separatists possibly want this outcome? For the simple reason that a viable path to securing Catalan independence remains elusive. Since 2011, both conservative and social democratic governments in Madrid have rejected a state-sanctioned independence referendum for Catalonia. So Catalan separatists are now banking on political victimhood as the best strategy for rebooting the independence project. To do this, they need to depict Catalonia as the victim of Madrid’s brutal oppression in the hopes that this would earn their cause international support.Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia until he fled to Belgium, where he remains today, to escape prosecution from Spanish authorities for having declared Catalonia an independent republic, has been exploiting the violence around the 2017 referendum to demonstrate the lengths that Madrid will go to deny Catalans the right to self-determination. On a recent trip to the United States, Quim Torra, Mr. Puigdemont’s successor, accused the Spanish government of violating civil and political rights in Catalonia and of holding “political prisoners.” At home, Catalan separatists have framed the trial that began this month of the 12 organizers of the illegal referendum on charges of rebellion and sedition as a persecution of Catalan nationalism.But for the victimhood strategy to succeed, the separatists need a better foil in Madrid than Mr. Sánchez and his Socialist government. Rather than dialogue and compromise, the separatists appear to desire intolerance and intransigence — maybe even a dose of violence. In other words, they want a Popular Party government supported by Vox and Ciudadanos, a center-right party from Catalonia that vehemently opposes Catalan independence. Because of the fragmentation of the party system, the results of an election more than a month away are difficult to predict. But given recent polling, it is easy to imagine the Popular Party — with support from Ciudadanos and Vox — being able to oust Mr. Sánchez.The consequences of a coalition government led by the Popular Party and incorporating Vox would extend far beyond the issue of Catalonia.

Now they could bring down the entire country.By Omar G. EncarnaciónMr. Encarnación is a professor and expert on Spanish politics.Anyone looking for evidence of how irrational politics can be should look to Catalonia right now.Earlier this month, Catalan separatists in the Spanish Parliament voted against the 2019 national budget proposal of the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, forcing a snap general election in late April. The separatists were retaliating against Mr. Sánchez because he would not agree to a referendum on Catalan independence. The last referendum, organized in October 2017, which was declared illegal by Spain’s Constitutional Tribunal and boycotted by those opposed to independence, plunged Spain into its deepest political crisis since the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975.In forcing early elections and the potential fall of the Sánchez government, which came to power in June following a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of the conservative Popular Party, the Catalan separatists appear willing to forfeit the best chance they have had in decades to advance Catalan autonomy. The Sánchez government has supported dialogue with Catalan separatists; appointed many Catalans to prominent cabinet positions, including Meritxell Batet, responsible for managing regional affairs; and agreed to a substantial increase in public spending in Catalonia for 2019. It even consented to talks about amending the Spanish Constitution to expand autonomy for all of Spain’s regions.Those gains could be quickly erased if the Popular Party is returned to power, something that the separatists were apparently aware of when they voted against the budget proposal. The newspaper El País reported that separatist leaders voted “with long faces” because they knew that they were most likely contributing to the rise of a new government that could reimpose direct control of Madrid over Catalonia as the Rajoy government did in 2017.Indeed, chances are that a new right-wing government in Madrid would be even more intolerant of Catalan separatism than Mr. Rajoy was. Since Mr. Rajoy’s departure from office, the Popular Party has hardened its stance on Catalan separatism, in no small measure because of the rise of Vox, a new far-right party that made a splash in regional elections in Andalusia in December, when it won 12 seats in the Andalusian Parliament on a platform that combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a hard line on the Catalonia crisis. Vox has gone as far as to call for abolishing altogether Spain’s system of regional autonomy and outlawing separatist political parties.Why would the separatists possibly want this outcome? For the simple reason that a viable path to securing Catalan independence remains elusive. Since 2011, both conservative and social democratic governments in Madrid have rejected a state-sanctioned independence referendum for Catalonia. So Catalan separatists are now banking on political victimhood as the best strategy for rebooting the independence project. To do this, they need to depict Catalonia as the victim of Madrid’s brutal oppression in the hopes that this would earn their cause international support.Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia until he fled to Belgium, where he remains today, to escape prosecution from Spanish authorities for having declared Catalonia an independent republic, has been exploiting the violence around the 2017 referendum to demonstrate the lengths that Madrid will go to deny Catalans the right to self-determination. On a recent trip to the United States, Quim Torra, Mr. Puigdemont’s successor, accused the Spanish government of violating civil and political rights in Catalonia and of holding “political prisoners.” At home, Catalan separatists have framed the trial that began this month of the 12 organizers of the illegal referendum on charges of rebellion and sedition as a persecution of Catalan nationalism.But for the victimhood strategy to succeed, the separatists need a better foil in Madrid than Mr. Sánchez and his Socialist government. Rather than dialogue and compromise, the separatists appear to desire intolerance and intransigence — maybe even a dose of violence. In other words, they want a Popular Party government supported by Vox and Ciudadanos, a center-right party from Catalonia that vehemently opposes Catalan independence. Because of the fragmentation of the party system, the results of an election more than a month away are difficult to predict. But given recent polling, it is easy to imagine the Popular Party — with support from Ciudadanos and Vox — being able to oust Mr. Sánchez.The consequences of a coalition government led by the Popular Party and incorporating Vox would extend far beyond the issue of Catalonia. It would be the first time the far right made it into a Spanish government since Franco’s death, and the toll on Spanish democracy would be enormous. It could bring an assault on the hard-won rights of women, immigrants and L.G.B.T. people.

Now they could bring down the entire country.By Omar G. EncarnaciónMr. Encarnación is a professor and expert on Spanish politics.Anyone looking for evidence of how irrational politics can be should look to Catalonia right now.Earlier this month, Catalan separatists in the Spanish Parliament voted against the 2019 national budget proposal of the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, forcing a snap general election in late April. The separatists were retaliating against Mr. Sánchez because he would not agree to a referendum on Catalan independence. The last referendum, organized in October 2017, which was declared illegal by Spain’s Constitutional Tribunal and boycotted by those opposed to independence, plunged Spain into its deepest political crisis since the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975.In forcing early elections and the potential fall of the Sánchez government, which came to power in June following a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of the conservative Popular Party, the Catalan separatists appear willing to forfeit the best chance they have had in decades to advance Catalan autonomy. The Sánchez government has supported dialogue with Catalan separatists; appointed many Catalans to prominent cabinet positions, including Meritxell Batet, responsible for managing regional affairs; and agreed to a substantial increase in public spending in Catalonia for 2019. It even consented to talks about amending the Spanish Constitution to expand autonomy for all of Spain’s regions.Those gains could be quickly erased if the Popular Party is returned to power, something that the separatists were apparently aware of when they voted against the budget proposal. The newspaper El País reported that separatist leaders voted “with long faces” because they knew that they were most likely contributing to the rise of a new government that could reimpose direct control of Madrid over Catalonia as the Rajoy government did in 2017.Indeed, chances are that a new right-wing government in Madrid would be even more intolerant of Catalan separatism than Mr. Rajoy was. Since Mr. Rajoy’s departure from office, the Popular Party has hardened its stance on Catalan separatism, in no small measure because of the rise of Vox, a new far-right party that made a splash in regional elections in Andalusia in December, when it won 12 seats in the Andalusian Parliament on a platform that combined anti-immigrant rhetoric with a hard line on the Catalonia crisis. Vox has gone as far as to call for abolishing altogether Spain’s system of regional autonomy and outlawing separatist political parties.Why would the separatists possibly want this outcome? For the simple reason that a viable path to securing Catalan independence remains elusive. Since 2011, both conservative and social democratic governments in Madrid have rejected a state-sanctioned independence referendum for Catalonia. So Catalan separatists are now banking on political victimhood as the best strategy for rebooting the independence project. To do this, they need to depict Catalonia as the victim of Madrid’s brutal oppression in the hopes that this would earn their cause international support.Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia until he fled to Belgium, where he remains today, to escape prosecution from Spanish authorities for having declared Catalonia an independent republic, has been exploiting the violence around the 2017 referendum to demonstrate the lengths that Madrid will go to deny Catalans the right to self-determination. On a recent trip to the United States, Quim Torra, Mr. Puigdemont’s successor, accused the Spanish government of violating civil and political rights in Catalonia and of holding “political prisoners.” At home, Catalan separatists have framed the trial that began this month of the 12 organizers of the illegal referendum on charges of rebellion and sedition as a persecution of Catalan nationalism.But for the victimhood strategy to succeed, the separatists need a better foil in Madrid than Mr. Sánchez and his Socialist government. Rather than dialogue and compromise, the separatists appear to desire intolerance and intransigence — maybe even a dose of violence. In other words, they want a Popular Party government supported by Vox and Ciudadanos, a center-right party from Catalonia that vehemently opposes Catalan independence. Because of the fragmentation of the party system, the results of an election more than a month away are difficult to predict. But given recent polling, it is easy to imagine the Popular Party — with support from Ciudadanos and Vox — being able to oust Mr. Sánchez.The consequences of a coalition government led by the Popular Party and incorporating Vox would extend far beyond the issue of Catalonia. It would be the first time the far right made it into a Spanish government since Franco’s death, and the toll on Spanish democracy would be enormous. It could bring an assault on the hard-won rights of women, immigrants and L.G.B.T. people. It could also unleash a wave of nationalism not seen in Spain since the Franco regime, one that would undermine regional home rule not only in Catalonia, but also in other regions like the Basque Country.Enabling the rise of the far right into government would also be a betrayal of the traditional values of the Catalan nationalist movement.
