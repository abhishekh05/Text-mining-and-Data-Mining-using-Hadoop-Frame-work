                Full text of Donald Trump's speech on immigration Wednesday night as prepared for delivery.  | Getty
                    By POLITICO STAFF08/31/2016 10:54 PM EDTRemarks as prepared for delivery and obtained by POLITICO Wednesday night. Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona, a state that has a very special place in my heart.Story Continued BelowI love the people of Arizona and, together, we are going to win the White House in November.Tonight is not going to be a normal rally speech.Instead, I am going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today: immigration.I have just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico – a man I like and respect very much, and a man who truly loves his country. Just like I am a man who loves the United States. We agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.

                    By NOLAN D. MCCASKILLWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the close friendship between our two nations.It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation. This is the first of what I expect will be many conversations in a Trump Administration about creating a new relationship between our two countries. But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington. There is no other way.The truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes. But the facts aren’t known because the media won’t report on them, the politicians won’t talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up.Today you will get the truth.The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn’t serve: it doesn’t serve you, the American people.When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages.Immigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.But if we are going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and sensitive issues.For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills, and living conditions. These are valid concerns, expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds.We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here.Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws. I have met with many of the parents who lost their children to Sanctuary Cities and open borders. They will be joining me on the stage later today.Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before. Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration’s priorities for removal.In California, a 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this doesn’t change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in.But these facts are never reported.Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing, and only this one thing: the needs of people living here illegally.The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants – or however many there may be. That has never been the central issue. It will never be the central issue. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington. Only out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don’t have legal status.To all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me today: there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and it is this: the well-being of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second.Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she’s not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable death. No, she’s only talking about families who came here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with dignity. We will be fair, just and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for American citizens.President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders. President Obama and Hillary Clinton support Sanctuary Cities, they support catch-and-release on the border, they support visa overstays, they support the release of dangerous criminals from detention – and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty. Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants – breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, especially African-American and Hispanic workers. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees in a four-year term.Now that you’ve heard about Hillary Clinton’s plan – about which she has not answered a single substantive question – let me tell you about my plan.While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, along with top immigration experts who represent workers, not corporations. I also worked with lawmakers who’ve led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years, and most importantly, I’ve met with the people directly impacted by these policies.Number One: We will build a wall along the Southern Border.On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border. We will use the best technology, including above-and below-ground sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out the criminal cartels, and Mexico will pay for the wall.Number Two: End Catch-And-ReleaseUnder my Administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.Number Three: Zero tolerance for criminal aliens.According to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country. We will begin moving them out day one, in joint operations with local, state and federal law enforcement. Beyond the 2 million, there are a vast number of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled or evaded justice. But their days on the run will soon be over. They go out, and they go out fast.Moving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings. We will terminate the Obama Administration’s deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets.Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities – these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who not detained or processed for deportation.My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this Administration. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction.On my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass “Kate’s Law” – named for Kate Steinle – to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences.Another reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously-deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly identified and removed. We are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and removing quickly the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice.The local police know who every one of these criminals are. There’s no great mystery to it, they’ve put up with it for years. And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess. We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks. We will expand the number of Border Patrol Stations.I’ve had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. The endorsement I’ve received from the Border Patrol officers means more to me than I can say.Number Four: Block Funding For Sanctuary CitiesWe will end the Sanctuary Cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. Number Five: Cancel Unconstitutional Executive Orders & Enforce All Immigration LawsWe will immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants. Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs – including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty.Clinton’s plan would trigger a Constitutional Crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. In a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement – and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation – that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges – that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who’ve come here under the current Administration. Number Six: We Are Going To Suspend The Issuance Of Visas To Any Place Where Adequate Screening Cannot OccurAccording to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. The number is likely higher, but the Administration refuses to provide this information to Congress.As soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place.Countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. For the price of resettling 1 refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region.Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.For instance, in the last five years, we’ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan – in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. Applicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure. Number Seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into U.S. communities. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick’s tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home.According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Many of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton’s watch – she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it. Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, who went on to reoffend at a very high rate.Number Eight: We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system.For years, Congress has required a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, but it has never been completed.In my Administration, we will ensure that this system is in place at all land, air, and sea ports. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never left. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and “would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.” Last year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my Administration. If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never leave – the Obama-Clinton policy – then we have a completely open border. We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.Number Nine: We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country. Immigration law doesn’t exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life – the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world.I will enforce all of our immigration laws.The same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for removal.Number 10: We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workersWe’ve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015.Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration – as we have following previous immigration waves – to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility. Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals:· To keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms · To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient. We need a system that serves our needs – remember, it’s America First. · To choose immigrants based on merit, skill and proficiency · And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first.We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and properly-vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest.We’ve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them. We wouldn’t put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?Let’s talk about the big pictureThese ten steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last fifty years.Because I am not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I will get this done for you and your family.We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our inner cities.For those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established.We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty. Our message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country. This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays. People will know that you can’t just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. Those days are over. In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system – then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.Right now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. Whether it’s dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing – and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton’s answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.These are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.What we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness.This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. This is it. We won’t get another opportunity – it will be too late.So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for – and who we are fighting for.So I am going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. [[PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS – EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD INTO THE MICROPHONE]]Now is the time for these voices to be heard.Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.Let’s fix this problem.Let’s secure our border.Let’s stop the drugs and the crime.Let’s protect our Social Security and Medicare.And let’s get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country.Together, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures.Together, we can save America itself.Join me in this mission to Make America Great Again.Thank you, and God Bless you all!Missing out on the latest scoops?

				Executive Orders			

			Immigration		

Issued on:
January 25, 2017
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation’s immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation’s southern border. Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws – and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders – the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation’s southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;(b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;(c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals’ claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;(d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed;(e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) “Asylum officer” has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).(b) “Southern border” shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.(c) “Border States” shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.(d) Except as otherwise noted, “the Secretary” shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.(e) “Wall” shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.(f) “Executive department” shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.(g) “Regulations” shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.(h) “Operational control” shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.Sec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States. The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.(c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as “catch and release,” whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).(b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Some immigrant U.S. Army reservists and recruits who enlisted in the military with a promised path to citizenship are being abruptly discharged, the Associated Press has learned.The AP was unable to quantify how many men and women who enlisted through the special recruitment program have been booted from the Army, but immigration attorneys say they know of more than 40 who have been discharged or whose status has become questionable, jeopardizing their futures.“It was my dream to serve in the military,” said reservist Lucas Calixto, a Brazilian immigrant who filed a lawsuit against the Army last week. “Since this country has been so good to me, I thought it was the least I could do to give back to my adopted country and serve in the United States military.”Some of the service members say they were not told why they were being discharged. Others who pressed for answers said the Army informed them they’d been labeled as security risks because they have relatives abroad or because the Defense Department had not completed background checks on them.Spokespeople for the Pentagon and the Army said that, due to the pending litigation, they were unable to explain the discharges or respond to questions about whether there have been policy changes in any of the military branches.Eligible recruits are required to have legal status in the U.S., such as a student visa, before enlisting. More than 5,000 immigrants were recruited into the program in 2016, and an estimated 10,000 are currently serving. Most go the Army, but some also go to the other military branches.To become citizens, the service members need an honorable service designation, which can come after even just a few days at boot camp. But the recently discharged service members have had their basic training delayed, so they can’t be naturalized.Margaret Stock, an Alaska-based immigration attorney and a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel who helped create the immigrant recruitment program, said she’s been inundated over the past several days by recruits who have been abruptly discharged.All had signed enlistment contracts and taken an Army oath, Stock said. Many were reservists who had been attending unit drills, receiving pay and undergoing training, while others had been in a “delayed entry” program, she said.“Immigrants have been serving in the Army since 1775,” Stock said. “We wouldn’t have won the revolution without immigrants. And we’re not going to win the global war on terrorism today without immigrants.”Stock said the service members she’s heard from had been told the Defense Department had not managed to put them through extensive background checks, which include CIA, FBI and National Intelligence Agency screenings and counterintelligence interviews. Therefore, by default, they do not meet the background check requirement.“It’s a vicious cycle,” she said.The AP interviewed Calixto and recruits from Pakistan and Iran, all of whom said they were devastated by their unexpected discharges.“Now the great feeling I had when I enlisted is going down the drain,” said Calixto, 28. “I don’t understand why this is happening.”In hopes of undoing the discharge, he filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., last week alleging the Defense Department hadn’t given him a chance to defend himself or appeal. He said he was given no specific grounds other than “personnel security.”Calixto, who lives in Massachusetts and came to the U.S. when he was 12, said in an email interview arranged through his attorney that he joined the Army out of patriotism.In the suit, Calixto said he learned he was being kicked out soon after he was promoted to private second class.The Pakistani service member who spoke to the AP said he learned in a phone call a few weeks ago that his military career was over.“There were so many tears in my eyes that my hands couldn’t move fast enough to wipe them away,” he said. “I was devastated, because I love the U.S. and was so honored to be able to serve this great country.”He asked that his name be withheld because he fears he might be forced to return to Pakistan, where he could face danger as a former U.S. Army enlistee.Portions of the 22-year-old’s military file reviewed by the AP said he was so deeply loyal to the U.S. that his relationships with his family and fiancee in Pakistan would not make him a security threat. Nonetheless, the documents show the Army cited those foreign ties as a concern.The man had enlisted in April 2016 anticipating he’d be a citizen within months, but faced a series of delays. He had been slated to ship out to basic training in January 2017, but that also was delayed.An Iranian citizen who came to the U.S. for a graduate degree in engineering told the AP that he enlisted in the program hoping to gain medical training. He said he had felt proud that he was “pursuing everything legally and living an honorable life.”In recent weeks, he said, he learned that he’d been discharged.“It’s terrible because I put my life in the line for this country, but I feel like I’m being treated like trash,” he said. “If I am not eligible to become a U.S. citizen, I am really scared to return to my country.”He spoke on condition of anonymity because of those fears.It’s unclear how the service members’ discharges could affect their status as legal immigrants.In a statement, the Defense Department said: “All service members (i.e. contracted recruits, active duty, Guard and Reserve) and those with an honorable discharge are protected from deportation.”However, immigration attorneys told the AP that many immigrants let go in recent weeks were an “uncharacterized discharge,” neither dishonorable nor honorable.The service members affected by the recent discharges all enlisted in recent years under a special program aimed at bringing medical specialists and fluent speakers of 44 sought-after languages into the military. The idea, according to the Defense Department, was to “recognize their contribution and sacrifice.”President George W. Bush ordered “expedited naturalization” for immigrant soldiers in 2002 in an effort to swell military ranks. Seven years later the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program, known as MAVNI, became an official recruiting program.It came under fire from conservatives when President Barack Obama added DACA recipients — young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally — to the list of eligible enlistees. In response, the military layered on additional security clearances for recruits to pass before heading to boot camp.The Trump Administration added even more hurdles, creating a backlog within the Defense Department. Last fall, hundreds of recruits still in the enlistment process had their contracts canceled. A few months later, the military suspended MAVNI.Republican Congressman Andy Harris of Maryland, who has supported legislation to limit the program, told the AP that MAVNI was established by executive order and never properly authorized by Congress.“Our military must prioritize enlisting American citizens, and restore the MAVNI program to its specialized, limited scope,” he said.Non-U.S. citizens have served in the military since the Revolutionary War, when Continental soldiers included Irish, French and Germans. The U.S. recruited Filipino nationals to serve in the Navy in the 1940s, and worked to enlist Eastern Europeans in the military over the next decade, according to the Defense Department.Since Sept. 11, 2001, nearly 110,000 members of the Armed Forces have gained citizenship by serving in the U.S. military, according to the Defense Department.Many service members recruited through the program have proven to be exemplary. In 2012, then-Sgt. Saral K. Shrestha, originally from Nepal, was named U.S. Army Soldier of the Year.In general, the immigrant recruits have been more cost-effective, outperforming their fellow soldiers in the areas of attrition, performance, education and promotions, according to a recently released review by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institution.The AP spoke with a 26-year-old woman from Dominica who said she proudly enlisted in the immigrant recruitment program in 2016 while earning her nursing degree. She said she drilled each month with her reserve unit, which gave her an award, and had been awaiting a date to start basic training.But in March, she said she looked up her profile on an Army portal and saw that the section about her security eligibility was marked “loss of jurisdiction,” with no further explanation. The next month, her attorney said she found the reservist’s name listed as “unsuitable” on a spreadsheet created by the Defense Department.The reservist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about her legal standing, said she received additional paperwork last month that indicated her case is awaiting a final decision.“I have always been a good soldier and have always done what they ask me to do,” she said. “I got into debt when I joined the Army because I can’t work legally but, financially, I can’t survive anymore. I don’t want to give up because I genuinely like being in the Army. But I don’t know who to turn to.”In recent years, a group of attorneys have been fighting to keep their recruited immigrant clients eligible for naturalization as delays have mounted. Some have been successful, including nearly 50 recruits who were granted a type of temporary status while their background investigations are being completed.“Some of our clients have finally emerged through the system and at least are doing basic training,” said Donald Friedman, a Washington attorney with Perkins Coie.___Burke reported from San Francisco.

Download PDF with CitationsFor more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not “criminals” by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime. Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence. As a result, immigrants have the stigma of “criminality” ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. Put differently, immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of “felonies” have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized. Higher Immigration is Associated with Lower Crime RatesImmigrants are Less Likely than the Native-Born to Be Behind Bars Immigrants are Less Likely Than the Native-Born to Engage in Criminal Behavior Despite the abundance of evidence that immigration is not linked to higher crime rates, and that immigrants are less likely to be criminals than the native-born, many U.S. policymakers succumb to their fears and prejudices about what they imagine immigrants to be. As a result, far too many immigration policies are drafted on the basis of stereotypes rather than substance. These laws are criminalizing an ever broadening swath of the immigrant population by applying a double standard when it comes to the consequences for criminal behavior. Immigrants who experience even the slightest brush with the criminal justice system, such as being convicted of a misdemeanor, can find themselves subject to detention for an undetermined period, after which they are expelled from the country and barred from returning. In other words, for years the government has been redefining what it means to be a “criminal alien,” using increasingly stringent definitions and standards of “criminality” that do not apply to U.S. citizens.Of course, these increasingly punitive laws are only as effective as the immigration-enforcement apparatus designed to support them. And this apparatus has expanded dramatically over the past three decades. More and more immigrants have been ensnared by enforcement mechanisms new and old, from worksite raids to Secure Communities. Detained immigrants are then housed in a growing nationwide network of private, for-profit prisons before they are deported from the United States. In short, as U.S. immigration laws create more and more “criminal aliens,” the machinery of detention and deportation grows larger as well, casting a widening dragnet over the nation’s foreign-born population in search of anyone who might be deportable. With the technologically sophisticated enforcement systems in place today, being stopped by a police officer for driving a car with a broken tail light can culminate in a one-way trip out of the country if the driver long ago pled guilty to a misdemeanor that has since been defined as a deportable offense.The scale of the federal government’s drive to criminalize immigration and expand the reach of the enforcement dragnet becomes very apparent when the proliferation of immigration laws, policies, and enforcement mechanisms is tracked over the past three decades. Two bills passed by Congress in 1996 stand as the most flagrant modern examples of laws which create a system of justice for non-U.S. citizens that is distinct from the system which applies to citizens. And, from old-fashioned worksite raids to the modern databases which are the heart of initiatives such as Secure Communities and the Criminal Alien Program (CAP), the government’s immigration-enforcement mechanisms continue to expand and reach deeper and deeper into the immigrant community. In the process, basic principles of fairness and equal treatment under the law are frequently left by the wayside.The United States is in the midst of a “great expulsion” of immigrants, both lawfully present and unauthorized, who tend to be non-violent and non-threatening and who often have deep roots in this country. This relentless campaign of deportation is frequently justified as a war against “illegality”—which is to say, against unauthorized immigrants. But that justification does not come close to explaining the banishment from the United States of lawful permanent residents who committed traffic offenses and who have U.S.-based families. Nor does it explain the lack of due-process rights accorded to so many of the immigrants ensnared in deportation proceedings. Likewise, the wave of deportations we are currently witnessing is often portrayed as a crime-fighting tool. But, as the findings of this report make clear, the majority of deportations carried out in the United States each year do not actually target “criminals” in any meaningful sense of the word.In November 2013, NPR reported that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had been instructed by Congress since 2009 to fill 34,000 beds in detention facilities across the country with immigrant detainees every day. It was immediately apparent that this sort of inmate quota would never fly if applied to native-born prisoners. As the NPR story puts it: “Imagine your city council telling the police department how many people it had to keep in jail each night.” Clearly, such a concept has nothing to do with fighting crime or protecting the public. But when it comes to the detention (and deportation) of immigrants, very different standards of justice and reason are at work.For more than a century, innumerable studies have confirmed two simple yet powerful truths about the relationship between immigration and crime: immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be behind bars than the native-born, and high rates of immigration are associated with lower rates of violent crime and property crime. This holds true for both legal immigrants and the unauthorized, regardless of their country of origin or level of education. In other words, the overwhelming majority of immigrants are not “criminals” by any commonly accepted definition of the term. For this reason, harsh immigration policies are not effective in fighting crime.Unfortunately, immigration policy is frequently shaped more by fear and stereotype than by empirical evidence, which is partly why immigrants are often treated like dangerous criminals by the U.S. immigration system. More precisely, immigrants have the stigma of “criminality” ascribed to them by an ever-evolving assortment of laws and immigration-enforcement mechanisms. From the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) to Operation Streamline (launched in 2005), immigrants are being defined more and more as threats. Whole new classes of “felonies” have been created which apply only to immigrants, deportation has become a punishment for even minor offenses, and policies aimed at trying to end unauthorized immigration have been made more punitive rather than more rational and practical. Moreover, as a growing body of “crimmigration” law has reimagined noncitizens as criminals and security risks, immigration law enforcement has increasingly adopted the securitized approach of criminal law enforcement. In short, immigrants themselves are being criminalized. As prominent immigration scholar Douglas Massey has written with regard to the plight of unauthorized immigrants in particular, “not since the days of slavery have so many residents of the United States lacked the most basic social, economic, and human rights.”This report tackles the criminalization of immigration from two angles. First, it documents the fact that immigration is not associated with “crime” as it is commonly understood. For more than two decades, rates of violent crime and property crime have fallen in the United States as the immigrant population (including the unauthorized population) has grown. Moreover, immigrants are less likely than the native-born to be behind bars or to engage in typically “criminal behaviors.” Second, the report describes the ways in which U.S. immigration laws and policies are re-defining the notion of “criminal” as it applies to immigrants, while also ramping up the enforcement programs designed to find anyone who might be deportable. More and more, a zero-tolerance policy has been applied by the federal government to immigrants who commit even the slightest offense or infraction. “Crimes” which might result in a fine or a suspended sentence for natives end up getting immigrants detained and deported. This represents a double standard of justice for immigrants in which the scale of the punishment (detention and deportation) far outweighs the severity of the crime (traffic offenses, for example). Unfortunately, this double standard has been the guiding principle behind a litany of immigration-enforcement laws and programs, such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), the 287(g) program, Secure Communities, and the “Consequence Delivery System” implemented by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in 2011.The evidence that immigrants tend not to be criminals is overwhelming. To begin with, there is an inverse relationship between crime and immigration. Crime rates in the United States have trended downward for many years at the same time that the number of immigrants has grown. Second, immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than the native-born. And, third, immigrants are less likely than the native-born to engage in the criminal behaviors that tend to land one in prison. No matter how you look at the issue, the inescapable conclusion is that immigrants are, on average, less prone to criminality than the U.S. native-born population.As the number of immigrants in the United States has risen in recent years, crime rates have fallen. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent {Figure 1} and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.2 million {Figure 2}. During the same period, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48 percent—which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder {Figure 3}. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41 percent, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary {Figure 4}. This decline in crime rates in the face of high levels of new immigration has been a steady national trend, and has occurred in cities across the country.The most thoroughly studied aspect of this phenomenon has been the drop in rates of violent crime since the early 1990s in cities that have long been “gateways” for immigrants entering the United States, such as Miami, Chicago, El Paso, San Antonio, and San Diego. However, the inverse relationship between immigration and crime is also apparent in “new” immigrant gateways, such as Austin, where rates of both violent crime and serious property crime have declined despite high levels of new immigration. Declining rates of property crime have also been documented in metropolitan areas across the country. Some scholars suggest that new immigrants may revitalize dilapidated urban areas, ultimately reducing violent crime rates.In short, to quote sociologist Robert J. Sampson, “cities of concentrated immigration are some of the safest places around.” The reason for this is straightforward. Immigrants as a group tend to be highly motivated, goal-driven individuals who have little to gain by running afoul of the law. As law professor and public-policy expert Michael Tonry puts it: “First-generation economic immigrants are self-selected risk takers who leave their homes, families, and languages to move to a new country to improve their and their children’s lives. They have good reasons to work hard, defer gratifications, and stay out of trouble.” Sampson and colleagues also find that immigrant communities are insulated from crime because they tend to display “social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good.”There is a sense of déjà vu in these modern-day findings. In the first three decades of the 20th century, during the last era of large-scale immigration, three government commissions studied the relationship between immigrants and crime and came to the same conclusion as contemporary researchers. The Industrial Commission of 1901, the [Dillingham] Immigration Commission of 1911, and the [Wickersham] National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement of 1931 each set out to measure how immigration increases crime. But each found lower levels of criminality among immigrants than among their native-born counterparts. A century ago, the report of the Dillingham Commission concluded: No satisfactory evidence has yet been produced to show that immigration has resulted in an increase in crime disproportionate to the increase in adult population. Such comparable statistics of crime and population as it has been possible to obtain indicate that immigrants are less prone to commit crime than are native Americans.Another concrete indication that immigrants are less likely than the native-born to be criminals is the fact that relatively few prisoners in the United States are immigrants. According to an original analysis of data from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the authors of this report, roughly 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born. This disparity in incarceration rates has existed for decades, as evidenced by data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses {Figure 5}. In each of those years, the incarceration rates of the native-born were anywhere from two to five times higher than that of immigrants. The pronounced difference between immigrants and the native-born in terms of incarceration rates also holds true in the case of those immigrants most likely to be unauthorized. The 2010 Census data reveals that incarceration rates among the young, less-educated Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men who make up the bulk of the unauthorized population are significantly lower than the incarceration rate among native-born young men without a high-school diploma. In 2010, less-educated native-born men age 18-39 had an incarceration rate of 10.7 percent—more than triple the 2.8 percent rate among foreign-born Mexican men, and five times greater than the 1.7 percent rate among foreign-born Salvadoran and Guatemalan men {Figure 6}.Research also indicates that such statistics are not simply the product of an effective immigration-enforcement system that removes immigrants from the country rather than holding them in U.S. prisons. According to a study by economists Kristin Butcher and Anne Morrison Piehl, the “evidence suggests that deportation and deterrence of immigrants’ crime commission from the threat of deportation are not driving the results. Rather, immigrants appear to be self-selected to have low criminal propensities and this has increased over time.” The study begins by using data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses to demonstrate that immigrants have had lower incarceration rates than the native-born for quite some time, and that this effect has been growing more pronounced with each passing decade. But the study then goes on to answer the question of whether these decreasing incarceration rates are the result of harsh immigration policies enacted in the 1990s, either because more immigrants were deported or because more were deterred from criminal behavior because of the threat of deportation. The answer to this question proved to be “no.” Nevertheless, it is clear from the ACS statistics that the incarceration rates for immigrant men rose between 2000 and 2010 (although they remained much lower than for native-born men). However, this is likely the product of changes in how immigration laws are enforced, not an indication of some immigrant predisposition towards “criminality” in the commonly understood sense of the word. The most probable explanation for the increase is that many more immigrant men were incarcerated for immigration-related offenses during the first decade of the 21stcentury as Congress redefined more and more immigration offenses as criminal (such as unauthorized entry or re-entry into the country), thus triggering criminal incarceration before deportation. These same factors also explain why immigrants are over represented in the federal prison system: while some may be there for committing a serious criminal offense, a great many more may be there because of an immigration violation. Moreover, it is important to keep in mind that the characteristics of the federal prison population do not necessarily speak to the U.S. prison population as a whole because the overwhelming majority of prisoners are not in federal prisons. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, federal inmates accounted for only 9 percent of all prisoners in 2010. Well over half (58 percent) were incarcerated in state prisons and a third (33 percent) in local jails. So, when anti-immigrant activists and politicians trumpet the out-of-context statistic that one-quarter of the inmates in federal prisons are foreign-born, that figure should not be taken at face value. Although there is no reliable source of data on immigrants incarcerated in state prisons and local jails, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) sought to overcome this limitation in a 2011 study. Not only did the study examine immigrants in federal prison during the Fiscal Year (FY) 2005-2010 period, but also non-federal immigrant prisoners for whom state and local governments had sought federal reimbursement of some incarceration costs through the U.S. Department of Justice’s State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) during the FY 2003-2009 period. The GAO found that, among the immigrant prisoners in its sample, 65 percent had been arrested at least once for (although not necessarily convicted of) an immigration violation, 48 percent for a drug offense, and 39 percent for traffic violations—all of which are generally non-violent acts. In comparison, 8 percent had been arrested at least once for homicide and 9 percent for robbery. The GAO also analyzed data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission and found that, in FY 2009, the “federal primary conviction” for 68 percent of offenders who were immigrants was an immigration-related violation—not a violent offense or any sort of crime which could be construed as a threat to public safety. The available evidence indicates that immigrants are not only less likely to end up behind bars than the native-born, but that immigrants are also less likely to commit criminal acts to begin with. For instance, a 2014 study found that “immigrants to the US are less likely to engage in violent or nonviolent antisocial behaviors than native-born Americans. Notably, native-born Americans were approximately four times more likely to report violent behavior than Asian and African immigrants and three times more likely than immigrants from Latin America.” The study analyzed data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to determine how often natives and immigrants engage in a wide range of violent and nonviolent “antisocial behaviors,” from hurting another person on purpose and using a weapon during a fight to shoplifting and lying.In a related vein, another 2014 study tracked 1,354 “high risk” adolescents over the course of seven years and found that the immigrants in the sample were less likely than the native-born to be repeat offenders. In the words of the authors, immigrants “appear to be on a path toward desistance much more quickly than their peers.” All of the adolescents in question had been convicted of a serious offense (usually a felony) in either a juvenile or adult court in Maricopa County, Arizona, or Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. The study sought to determine who became a “persistent offender” and who did not.A 2010 study yielded similar findings based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Add Health offers a “national, longitudinal account of delinquency by gender, race/ethnicity, and immigrant group from the onset of adolescence (ages 11-12) to the transition into adulthood (ages 25-26).” The study found that “immigrant youth who enrolled in U.S. middle and high schools in the mid-1990s and who are young adults today had among the lowest delinquency rates of all youth.” The authors conclude that the national-level data gathered by Add Health “debunk(s) the myth of immigrant criminality. Fears that immigration will lead to an escalation of crime and delinquency are unfounded.”Despite the abundance of evidence that immigration is not linked to higher crime rates, and that immigrants are less likely to be criminals than the native-born, many U.S. policymakers succumb to their fears and prejudices about what they imagine immigrants to be. As a result, far too many immigration policies are drafted on the basis of stereotypes rather than substance. These laws are criminalizing an ever broadening swath of the immigrant population by applying a double standard when it comes to the consequences for criminal behavior. Immigrants who experience even the slightest brush with the criminal justice system, such as being convicted of a misdemeanor, can find themselves subject to detention for an undetermined period, after which they are expelled from the country and barred from returning. This reality is at the core of what law professor Juliet Stumpf calls “crimmigration”—the “criminalization of immigration law.” Stumpf argues that “as criminal sanctions for immigration-related conduct and criminal grounds for removal from the United States continue to expand, aliens become synonymous with criminals." In other words, for years the government has been redefining what it means to be a “criminal alien,” using increasingly stringent definitions and standards of “criminality” that do not apply to U.S. citizens.Of course, these increasingly punitive laws are only as effective as the immigration-enforcement apparatus designed to support them. And this apparatus has expanded dramatically over the past three decades. More and more immigrants have been ensnared by enforcement mechanisms new and old, from worksite raids to Secure Communities. Detained immigrants are then housed in a growing nationwide network of private, for-profit prisons before they are deported from the United States. In short, as U.S. immigration laws create more and more “criminal aliens,” the machinery of detention and deportation grows larger as well, casting a widening dragnet over the nation’s foreign-born population in search of anyone who might be deportable. With the technologically sophisticated enforcement systems in place today, being stopped by a police officer for driving a car with a broken tail light can culminate in a one-way trip out of the country if the driver long ago pled guilty to a misdemeanor that has since been defined as a deportable offense.Misleading Language in the “Official” Deportation StatisticsThe definition of “criminal alien” used by the federal government is clearly inconsistent with the general public’s understanding of serious crime. The term represents a terminological sleight-of-hand used to justify a punitive approach to immigration enforcement that is based on incarceration and deportation. An important part of the government’s attempt to redefine what it means to be a “criminal alien,” with all the social and legal implications this label carries, becomes clear upon closer consideration of the data on enforcement actions that is released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). According to DHS, 438,421 foreign nationals were removed from the United States in FY 2013. Among those removed, roughly 45 percent (198,394) were classified as “known criminal aliens.” (Along these lines, the director of ICE testified before Congress that “eighty-five percent of individuals removed or returned from the interior were previously convicted of a criminal offense”).However, a more detailed examination of the data clearly illustrates that the majority of “criminal aliens” are in factnot being removed for what most Americans perceive to be serious crime, such as the FBI’s eight Index Crimes, which consist of “Part I” offenses (homicide, assault, forcible rape, and robbery) and “Part II” offenses (larceny, burglary, motor vehicle theft and arson). In fact, DHS’s FY 2013 enforcement actions indicate that serious crimes such as “Assault,” “Robbery,” “Burglary,” and “Sexual Assault” collectively make up only one-fifth of the crime categories for which “criminal aliens” were removed. Nearly one-third (31.3 percent) of “criminal aliens” were removed for “Immigration” offenses (i.e., illegal entry or reentry into the United States), followed by 15.4 percent for “Dangerous Drugs” (which includes possession of marijuana), and 15 percent for “Criminal Traffic Offenses” (including both Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and “hit and run”). Also noteworthy are an additional 14.2 percent of “criminal aliens” who were removed for “All other categories, including unknown” {Figure 7}.The criminalization of immigration involves much more than the manipulation of official deportation statistics. It is also driven by a massive expansion in the infrastructure for the detention of immigrants who fit one or more of the growing list of offenses that qualify as “criminal” for immigration purposes. The immigrant-detention industry began to expand in earnest during the early 1980s following the creation of the Krome Avenue Detention Center in Miami to detain Mariel refugees from Cuba. Moreover, at the same time the immigration detention system has grown, the nation’s prison system has become increasingly privatized. The end result is the federal government’s reliance upon private prison corporations, such as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and The GEO Group, to handle the burgeoning inflows of “criminal aliens.”As the immigrant-detention industry grew, so did the redefinition of “immigrants” as an inherently dangerous group of people. This can be attributed in part to the fact that private prison companies work actively to shape the federal and state laws governing corrections and law-enforcement. The companies make sizeable campaign contributions to politicians, and lobby Congress and state legislatures on bills that affect their interests. These companies also belong to organizations such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which champions free markets, limited government, and public-private partnerships that bring together federal and state legislators with members of the private sector. These partnerships can wield considerable power. For instance, there are indications that ALEC and CCA may have played a major role in drafting the legislation that would become Arizona’s infamous anti-immigrant law, SB 1070. This scenario represents a conflict of interest in which a company that has a vested financial interest in the incarceration of as many people as possible is influencing legislation that will increase the flow of prisoners into that company’s prisons. One can only wonder if this business ethic is behind the fact that ICE is now required by law “to maintain an average daily population of 34,000 detainees.”The scale of the federal government’s drive to criminalize immigration and expand the reach of the enforcement dragnet becomes very apparent when the proliferation of immigration laws, policies, and enforcement mechanisms is tracked over the past three decades. The 1996 laws stand as the most flagrant modern examples of laws which create a system of justice for non-U.S. citizens that is distinct from the system which applies to citizens. And, from old-fashioned worksite raids to the modern databases which are the heart of initiatives such as Secure Communities and the Criminal Alien Program (CAP), the government’s immigration-enforcement mechanisms continue to expand and reach deeper and deeper into the immigrant community. In the process, basic principles of fairness and equal treatment under the law are frequently left by the wayside.Worksite Immigration RaidsFor decades, worksite raids of businesses employing unauthorized immigrants were a mainstay of immigration enforcement in the United States. In recent times, their economic and social destructiveness are perhaps best exemplified by the case of Postville, Iowa. On May 12, 2008, 389 workers were arrested during an immigration raid at Postville’s Agriprocessors, Inc. meatpacking plant. The consequences for the community and the local economy have been dire. According to the authors of Postville U.S.A., one year after the raid, Postville “lost 40% of its pre-raid population, the economy was in shambles, the city government teetered on the brink of financial collapse, and the future of the town’s major employer grew increasingly doubtful with time.” Long after the Agriprocessors raid, Postville was still what its leaders described as “a human and economic disaster area.” The population loss meant steep losses for Postville in taxes and utility revenue. Local businesses closed, rental units remained empty, and the town couldn’t pay its bills. According to the book’s authors: “Attempts to come up with simple black-and-white solutions, such as arresting undocumented workers or closing down the companies that employ them, often causes a host of far more complex situations that do little to address any of the real concerns expressed by either side in the immigration debate.”The use of worksite raids as an enforcement mechanism has waned in recent years, although unauthorized workers are occasionally still swept up in such raids. According to ICE, in FY 2012, the agency made “520 criminal arrests tied to worksite enforcement investigations. Of the individuals criminally arrested, 240 were owners, managers, supervisors or human resources employees.” The remaining were workers who faced charges “such as aggravated identity theft and Social Security fraud.”The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) is perhaps best known for providing an avenue to legal status for most unauthorized immigrants in the country at that time. However, IRCA also spurred the creation of new immigration-enforcement programs targeting noncitizens with criminal convictions. Among those programs were two that eventually became ICE’s Criminal Alien Program (CAP) —a moniker which actually encompasses a number of different systems designed to identify, detain, and begin removal proceedings against deportable immigrants within federal, state, and local prisons and jails. CAP is currently active in all state and federal prisons, as well as more than 300 local jails throughout the country. It is one of several so-called “jail status check” programs intended to screen individuals in federal, state, or local prisons and jails for removability. CAP is by far the oldest and largest such interface between the criminal justice system and federal immigration authorities. CAP also encompasses other activities, including the investigation and arrest of some noncitizens who are not detained.Regardless of its official intent, in practice CAP encourages local police to engage in ethnic profiling. In particular, police are motivated to arrest as many Latinos as possible in order to snare as many deportable immigrants as possible. For instance, one study found:The War on DrugsStarting in the mid-1980s, the expansion of the infrastructure for detention in the United States was based not only on an escalating crackdown on immigrants, but was also a central component of the “war on drugs.” While IRCA and the Immigration Act of 1990 specifically expanded immigration detention, prisons were also filled with offenders—immigrant and native-born alike—on the basis of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (which created the concept of the “aggravated felony”), the Crime Control Act of 1990, and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, among other laws. In fact, the battles against illegal drugs and “illegal aliens” were frequently linked to each other in the political rhetoric of the time. The result was a growing number of prisons and a growing number of offenders to fill them.1996 LawsThe year 1996 was pivotal in terms of the criminalization of immigration. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) transformed immigration law in two profound ways. First, the laws mandated the detention and deportation of noncitizens (lawful permanent residents and unauthorized immigrants alike) who had been convicted of an “aggravated felony,” including individuals who may have pled guilty to minor charges to avoid jail time by opting for probation. Second, the laws expanded the list of offenses that qualify as “aggravated felonies” for immigration purposes, and applied this new standard retroactively to offenses committed years before the laws were enacted.A classic example of just how unfair these laws can be is the case of Mary Anne Gehris, who was born in Germany in 1965 but adopted by U.S.-citizen parents when she was two years old and taken to live in the United States. In 1988, she got into a fight with another woman over a boyfriend, pulled that woman’s hair, and ended up pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault. In 1999, she applied for U.S. citizenship and found herself in deportation proceedings instead because the 1996 immigration reforms defined her 1988 misdemeanor assault conviction as a “crime of violence.” Fortunately, the Georgia Board of Pardons intervened on Ms. Gehris’s behalf and pardoned her, thereby sparing her from deportation and allowing her to become a U.S. citizen. But many other non-citizens have not been so lucky and have found themselves deported to countries they have not seen since they were children.287(g) ProgramCreated by IIRIRA in 1996, 287(g)—which refers to the relevant section of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)—allows DHS to deputize select state and local law-enforcement officers to perform the functions of federal immigration agents. Like employees of ICE, so-called “287(g) officers” have access to federal immigration databases, may interrogate and arrest noncitizens believed to have violated federal immigration laws, and may lodge “detainers” against alleged noncitizens held in state or local custody. The program has attracted a wide range of critics since the first 287(g) agreement was signed more than 10 years ago. Among other concerns, opponents say the program lacks proper federal oversight, diverts resources from the investigation of local crimes, and results in profiling of Latino residents—as was documented following the entry into a 287(g) agreement with Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona. Following the nationwide expansion of the Secure Communities program, which has its own drawbacks but is operated exclusively by federal authorities, critics have asked whether the 287(g) program continues to offer any law-enforcement benefit. In its budget justification for FY 2013, DHS sought $17 million less in funding for the 287(g) program, and said that in light of the expansion of Secure Communities, “it will no longer be necessary to maintain the more costly and less effective 287(g) program.”While 287(g) may be on the way out, it is important to keep in mind that state governments have repeatedly sought to enlist their police forces in immigration enforcement without the cooperation or permission of federal authorities. Arizona’s SB 1070 and Alabama’s HB 56 are the most notorious examples of sweeping anti-immigrant laws that sought to turn police officers into immigration-enforcement agents. Although major provisions of these laws were struck down in the courts as a preemption of federal immigration-enforcement powers, other onerous provisions have survived. In Arizona, for instance, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provision of SB 1070 that permits police to conduct immigration status checks during law-enforcement stops. Even if 287(g) programs eventually cease to exist, anti-immigrant laws introduced in state houses will remain a very real equivalent.September 11The U.S. government responded to the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the same way it has in so many other times of national crisis: by using “national security” as a justification for incarcerating and deporting greater numbers of immigrants. “Foreigners” were broadly defined as potential threats and were detained on immigration-related charges that do not require the same standard of proof that is necessary in a criminal investigation. Although federal authorities first targeted Arabs, Muslims, and South Asians in the aftermath of 9/11, the “war on terror” has had an impact on all immigrants regardless of ethnicity or legal status—including Latin American immigrants, particularly Mexicans, who comprise the majority of immigration detainees. Post-9/11 policies not only increased funding for various immigration-enforcement functions as part of the broader effort to enhance national security, but fostered an “us or them” mentality in which “they” are the foreign-born.More precisely, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 collectively “illustrate the accelerating criminalization of the immigration system.” This intersection of criminal and immigration law has led to a notable increase in deportations. As Stumpf notes, in the period “between 1908 and 1980, there were approximately 56,000 immigrants deported based on criminal convictions. In 2004 alone, there were more than 88,000 such deportations.” While immigration law had been used by U.S. authorities to remove non-citizens who came into contact with the criminal justice system in the pre-9/11 era, the relationship between these two systems of law intensified after 9/11. As law professor Teresa A. Miller notes, “After the attacks, zero-tolerance enforcement of immigration laws was extended to immigrants who had not passed through the criminal justice system, such as asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants.” The PATRIOT Act in particular allowed federal officers to apprehend and detain “non-citizens on immigration grounds without legal review and without public disclosure of the specific charge for a period of seven days, or for a maximum of six months if the case is deemed a national security risk.”The “war on terror” thus had immediate implications for foreign-born individuals residing in the United States. As Miller states: “In January of 2002, Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson announced a new initiative to ‘locate, apprehend, interview, and deport’ approximately 314,000 noncitizens who had been ordered deported, but had failed to comply with their deportation orders.” This initiative led to the arrest of more than 1,100 Muslim and Arab men without formally charging them with a crime. However, the consequences of the PATRIOT Act extended beyond these individuals and into immigrant communities, ultimately being manifested through “racial profiling and scapegoating, mass detentions and mistreatment, and the government’s refusal to disclose information about those detained.”A prime example of the enforcement-only mindset of DHS and its component agencies in the post-9/11 era is “Operation Endgame”—the name given to the “Office of Detention and Removal Strategic Plan, 2003–2012,” which was released on June 27, 2003, by Anthony S. Tangeman, Director of ICE’s Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO). Tangeman succinctly explains the rationale underlying his department’s new strategic plan:As the title implies, DRO provides the endgame to immigration enforcement and that is the removal of all removable aliens. This is also the essence of our mission statement and the ‘golden measure’ of our success. We must endeavor to maintain the integrity of the immigration process and protect our homeland by ensuring that every alien who is ordered removed, and can be, departs the United States as quickly as possible and as effectively as practicable. We must strive for 100% removal rate.However, Tangeman’s assertions about how best to “protect our homeland” ring hollow given that the vast majority of immigrants aren’t criminals (let alone terrorists), and that even minor infractions can render an immigrant “deportable” under current law. Yet the Tangeman memo, and the strategic plan it introduces, treat all immigrants as potential security risks—a paranoid worldview that has become widespread not only throughout the federal government, but in many state and local governments as well.Operation StreamlineThe federal government’s detention-and-deportation machine is also being fed by Operation Streamline, a program begun in 2005 in the southwest of the country under which unauthorized border-crossers are prosecuted in group trials and convicted of illegal entry into the country—a misdemeanor. If they cross again, they may be convicted of an aggravated felony and face up to two years in prison. Although these offenses have been on the books since 1929, they are being applied under Operation Streamline more widely than they ever were before. Yet the structure of Operation Streamline—in which up to 80 immigrants are tried at a time, and each defendant has only a few minutes to speak to an attorney—practically guarantees the violation of basic legal and human rights. In addition, Streamline—which currently operates in all but three southwestern Border Patrol Sectors—has fueled a surge in immigration prosecutions over the past decade, severely straining the capacities of courtrooms along the border and clogging the courts with petty immigration offenses. According to Justice Department data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), immigration prosecutions “reached an all-time high” in FY 2013 with 97,384 (53,789 for “illegal entry” and 37,346 for “illegal re-entry”). This marks an increase of 367 percent over the number of prosecutions 10 years earlier. Between FY 2005-2012, a “total of 208,939 people were processed through Operation Streamline,” which represents 45 percent of the 463,051 immigration-related prosecutions in Southwest border districts during this time period. U.S. Sentencing Commission data analyzed by the Pew Research Center finds that the “Dramatic growth over the past two decades in the number of offenders sentenced in federal courts has been driven primarily by enforcement of a particular immigration offense—unlawful reentry into the United States.” Predictably, Operation Streamline has diverted resources away from drug and human smuggling prosecutions. All this means that massive amounts of time, money, and manpower are being wasted on the prosecution of non-violent immigrants who do not represent a threat to public safety or national security. Secure CommunitiesAlthough the double standards inherent in immigration law have been applied to immigrants for more than a decade and a half, they took on new meaning starting in 2008 with the launch and dramatic expansion of Secure Communities. This was (or still is, depending on one’s perspective) a DHS program, eventually activated in all 3,181 jurisdictions across the United States, which used biometric data to screen for deportable immigrants as people were being booked into jails. Under Secure Communities, an arrestee’s fingerprints were run not only against criminal databases, but immigration databases as well. If there was an immigration “hit,” ICE could issue a “detainer” requesting that the jail hold the person in question until ICE could pick them up.Not surprisingly, given the new classes of “criminals” created by IIRIRA, most of the immigrants scooped up by Secure Communities were non-violent and not a threat to anyone. In fact, one report found that in Los Angeles County, “the vast majority of those deported through Secure Communities have merely had contact with local law enforcement and have not committed serious crimes.” Moreover, as the program metastasized throughout every part of the country, more and more people were thrown into immigration detention prior to deportation, which led to mounting financial costs. As of September 30, 2013, 306,622 immigrants convicted of crimes had been removed from the United States after identification through Secure Communities.More broadly, regardless of whether they were identified through Secure Communities or not, the overwhelming majority of people receiving ICE detainers while in the custody of local, state, and federal law-enforcement officials had no criminal record. For instance, among the nearly one million detainers issued by ICE during a 50-month period during FY 2008-2012, over 77 percent consisted of individuals who “had no criminal record—either at the time the detainer was issued or subsequently.” Records from this same time period illustrate that for “the remaining 22.6 percent that had a criminal record, only 8.6 percent of the charges were classified as a Level 1 offense” {Figure 8}.Secure Communities was not a practical or responsible approach to public safety. It undermined community policing by creating distrust of local law enforcement within immigrant communities, which in turn made community members less likely to report crimes or cooperate with local authorities in on-going investigations due to fear of deportation. This had negative consequences for public safety. Secure Communities, along with other programs of its kind, also led to the separation of U.S.-citizen children from their parents. These were issues that could not be fixed by simply altering the program. Further, one study found that “ICE’s failure to adhere to its own stated priorities is a feature rather than a reparable flaw of the program” and “has led to increased use of racial profiling in policing.”The current status of Secure Communities is somewhat murky. In February 2013, ICE stated that it would transfer “full responsibility” for the day-to-day management of Secure Communities to CAP, and began to redirect Secure Communities funding towards CAP. But Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced in a November 20, 2014, memo that, due to widespread opposition to the program by law-enforcement officers and elected officials, “the Secure Communities program, as we know it, will be discontinued.” It is to be replaced by the “Priority Enforcement Program” (PEP), under which ICE can “issue a request for detention” to state or local law-enforcement agencies if it can “specify that the person is subject to a final order of removal or there is other sufficient probable cause to find that the person is a removable alien.” It remains to be seen how substantively different PEP will be from Secure Communities.CBP’s Consequence Delivery SystemThe systematic criminalization of unauthorized immigrants in particular has intensified along the U.S.-Mexico border. In 2011, CBP, in collaboration with ICE, rolled out a program described as the Consequence Delivery System (CDS). Rooted in the notion of specific deterrence, CDS is designed “to break the smuggling cycle and deter a subject from attempting further illegal entries or participating in a smuggling enterprise.” The program “guides management and agents through a process designed to uniquely evaluate each subject and identify the ideal consequences to deliver to impede and deter further illegal activity.” Possible “consequences” under this initiative include, but are not limited to, being processed through the Alien Transfer and Exit Program (commonly referred to a “lateral repatriation,” often resulting in people being sent to unfamiliar and dangerous Mexican border towns plagued with drug war violence), being repatriated to Mexico in the middle of the night, or being charged with “unauthorized entry” (a misdemeanor) or “unauthorized re-entry” (a felony), which commonly occurs through Operation Streamline. Not only has CDS contributed to the further criminalization of immigration, but it has also needlessly contributed to the increased vulnerability of the already vulnerable unauthorized population.Executive ActionWith Congress perennially deadlocked over comprehensive immigration reform legislation, the Obama administration eventually took matters into its own hands. On November 20 and 21, 2014, President Obama announced a series of “executive actions” that would grant a temporary reprieve from deportation, and work authorization, to as many as 5.3 million unauthorized immigrants (5.8 million remain ineligible). This would be accomplished through expansion of the already functioning 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, as well as the creation of a new deferred action program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). DACA offers temporary relief from deportation (and temporary work authorization) to qualified young adults who were brought to the United States as children. DAPA would grant temporary relief from deportation, as well as temporary work authorization, to some unauthorized parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. However, neither DAPA nor the expansion of DACA can get off the ground until the legal challenges to them are resolved in court. So it remains to be seen how the President’s “executive action” will impact the drive to deportation that still permeates the U.S. immigration system. Moreover, the rhetoric used by the Obama administration in justifying executive action—such as saying that immigration authorities will now target only “felons, not families” —fails to account for the fact that there are a great many “felons” who have committed only immigration offenses and pose a threat to no one.There are many signs that the U.S. immigration-enforcement system has run amok. Deportations during the Obama Administration have exceeded the two-million mark. Families and communities have been and are being needlessly torn apart in the process. And each year, billions upon billions of dollars are spent on border and interior enforcement, while hundreds of migrants die in the deserts and mountains of the southwest trying to cross into the country from Mexico—sometimes while trying to reach their families in the United States. These are tragedies that could be prevented—if only Congress would choose to inject proportionality, discretion, and a little humanity back into the immigration system.While lawmakers repeatedly justify their crackdown on immigrants as a means of fighting crime, the reality is that crime in the United States is not caused or even aggravated by immigrants, regardless of their legal status. This is hardly surprising since immigrants come to the United States to pursue economic and educational opportunities not available in their home countries and to build better lives for themselves and their families. As a result, they have little to gain and much to lose by breaking the law. Unauthorized immigrants in particular have even more reason to not run afoul of the law given the risk of deportation that their lack of legal status entails. But the terminological sleight-of-hand inherent in the government’s definition of “criminal alien” perpetuates and exacerbates the fallacy of a link between immigration and crime.Public policies must be based on facts, not anecdotes or emotions. And the fact is that the vast majority of immigrants are not “criminals” in any meaningful sense of the word. The bulk of the immigration-enforcement apparatus in this country is not devoted to capturing the “worst of the worst” foreign-born criminals. Rather, as Secure Communities exemplifies all too well, the detention-and-deportation machine is designed primarily to track down and expel non-violent individuals, including legal residents of the United States who have worked and raised families here for many years. This brand of immigration policy is cruel, pointless, shortsighted, and counterproductive. And it is not an effective substitute for immigration reform which makes our immigration system responsive to the economic and social forces which drive migration in the first place.The United States is in the midst of a “great expulsion” of immigrants, both lawfully present and unauthorized, who tend to be non-violent and non-threatening and who often have deep roots in this country. This relentless campaign of deportation is frequently justified as a war against “illegality”—which is to say, against unauthorized immigrants. But that justification does not come close to explaining the banishment from the United States of lawful permanent residents who committed traffic offenses and who have U.S.-based families. Nor does it explain the lack of due-process rights accorded to so many of the immigrants ensnared in deportation proceedings. Likewise, the wave of deportations we are currently witnessing is often portrayed as a crime-fighting tool. But, as the findings of this report make clear, the majority of deportations carried out in the United States each year do not actually target “criminals” in any meaningful sense of the word.Policymakers who look at the entire foreign-born population of the United States through a law-enforcement lens are seeing things that aren’t really there. As renowned psychologist Abraham H. Maslow wrote many years ago, “it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” The blunt weapon that is the U.S. immigration-enforcement apparatus is being wielded against a widening swath of the immigrant community, regardless of their ties to this country, regardless of whether or not they are actually criminals. It is long past time for U.S. immigration policies to accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of immigration to this country, based not on a reflexive politics of fear and myth, but on sound analysis and empirical evidence.Get the latest from the American Immigration Council in your inbox.The American Immigration Council is a non-profit, non-partisan organization.1331 G St. NW, Suite 200, Washington, D.C., 20005 | 202-507-7500

Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your WorldWhy does the crime rate soar among second-generation immigrants compared with their foreign-born peers?  Until recently, most sociologists have explained this increase by noting that many second-generation immigrants feel caught between two conflicting worlds—the old world of their parents and the new world of their birth.But recently researchers have posited an alternate theory:  Second-generation immigrants are just “catching up” with the rest of us, claims Bianca E. Bersani, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.Call it the dark side of assimilation. These second-generation immigrants have become as susceptible to temptation and harmful influences as are other Americans according to Bersani.  The unhappy consequence is a similar likelihood of committing a crime, Bersani wrote in an article published online by the journal Crime & Delinquency.Other studies have documented how second-generation immigrants have become more like the typical American, both in positive and negative ways. For example, a Pew Research Center analysis of Census data earlier this year found that median family income of second-generation immigrants is virtually identical to the national median and higher than their foreign-born counterparts.  Home ownership rates follow a similar trajectory.In her study, Bersani analyzed crime data collected from first- and second-generation immigrants. She then compared those crime rates with the other native-born adults and found striking similarities between second-generation immigrants and native-born non-Hispanic whites.She begins her analysis by noting this well-documented phenomenon:  The crime rate among first-generation immigrants—those who came to this country from somewhere else—is significantly lower than the overall crime rate and that of the second generation. It’s even lower for those in their teens and early 20s, the age range when criminal involvement peaks.But just a generation later, the crime rate soars.  In fact, it is virtually identical to the rate among native-born Americans across the most crime-prone years.  As the accompanying chart taken from an earlier Bersani study shows, about a quarter of 16-year-old native-born and second-generation immigrants have committed a crime in the past year. In contrast, about 17% of the foreign-born 16-year olds have broken the law.What explains the difference?Some researchers say the generations face two different sets of experiences, with the second generation—those with at least one parent who was born abroad—caught in the middle. They argue the second generation is caught between conflicting family and social values and expectations, and one result of this old world/new world conflict is a greater propensity to commit crime.  For more details, see this 1992 study.To explore the causes of crime among second-generation immigrants, Besani used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, a household-based, representative sample of people living in the U.S. in 1997 who were born from 1980 through 1984. The initial sample includes 8,984 youth who have been interviewed on an annual basis beginning in 1997. The dataset she used contained data collected through 2005.The survey questioned respondents on sensitive topics, including the number of times they had a purposely damaged or destroyed property, committed a theft, sold or helped to sell drugs, attacked someone with the intent of hurting them or got into a serious fight in the past year.In addition to crime data, the survey included information on important risk factors that researchers say are closely correlated with criminal involvement. They included whether the respondent had been a victim of a crime as a youth, various measures of family attachment as well as performance and attachment to school, whether the respondent had delinquent peers, lived in a neighborhood with gangs, or whether any of the respondent’s peers were gang members.Then Bersani compared second-generation immigrants with other native-born groups. She found that the results supported her theory that “their involvement in crime is the result of the same factors that explain involvement in crime among typical native-born youth.”For example, having peers in a gang increased the probability that an individual had been arrested in the previous year by 23% for second-generation immigrants and 25% for native-born non-Hispanic whites, Bersani wrote in an email. Similarly, having delinquent peers increases the likelihood of criminal or delinquent behavior by 6% for both groups. (The pattern was more mixed between second-generation immigrants and native-born blacks and Hispanics.)This similar offending “profile” is strong evidence, she argues, that the generation crime gap among immigrants is due to the second-generation behaving like their native-born peers and not only as a consequence of growing up in two colliding worlds.“Second generation immigrants appear to be catching-up to and resemble the typical native-born (white) population, at least in regard to their offending profile,” she wrote. These findings “suggest that the children of immigrants seemingly fall prey to criminogenic influences in similar ways that native-born youth do.”

Archbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami, photographed at a news conference in 2015, said the Trump administration's policy of separating immigrant children from their families "goes against the values of our nation."A Trump administration policy of separating children from their parents on the U.S. border has prompted a crescendo of criticism among religious leaders. They span different faiths, denominations and ages. Some of them have also helped the president gain support for his base. About 11,000 children are in shelters, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Nearly 2,000 children were removed from the care of their parents and taken into federal custody between April 19 and May 31, an immigration official said Friday. That practice effectively "weaponizes" children, Archbishop of Miami Thomas Wenski told NPR's Weekend Edition on Saturday. "Basically the administration has, in deciding to separate children from their parents, [tried] to weaponize children, using them as a leverage against the parents applying for their asylum applications." He said that border agents and administration should "use their conscience," while policymakers should do some "soul searching." Evangelical leader Franklin Graham, son of "America's pastor" Billy Graham and a prominent Trump supporter, told the Christian Broadcasting Network on Tuesday, "It's disgraceful, and it's terrible to see families ripped apart and I don't support that one bit." His words follow an April survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that 75 percent of white evangelicals held favorable views of Trump.Tony Suarez, a Latino pastor who has informally advised Trump, tweeted, "God have mercy on those who seem so nonchalant to the plight of children being separated from their parents."Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and archbishop of Galveston-Houston in Texas, said in a statement, "Separating babies from their mothers is not the answer and is immoral." Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, called it "unconscionable," saying, "Those at the highest levels of the Trump administration are responsible and must provide the public a clear explanation of how this happened and how these families will be reunited."Embers of disapproval were stoked when Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited scripture on Thursday in defense of the administration's tough immigration policies. "I would cite you to the apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes," he said.Historians and faith leaders were quick to point out that such passages were also used to justify slavery. "The founders of this nation used the same tactics to enslave our African forebears by lifting from the writings of the Apostle Paul passages to condone slavery and to break their spirit," the African Methodist Episcopal Church stated. It called Sessions'remarks "sad and sinful."Jentezen Franklin, a member of Trump's evangelical council, told CNN, "It's a very dangerous route to go when you begin to take selections of scriptures and say, 'The Bible was written to justify political standings. The Bible was never written as a political road map.' " Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who in March said that the "big tent of the Democratic Party now seems a pup tent," called the breaking up of families "un-American and unbiblical." In an interview on Friday with CNN, he said, "If they want to take a baby from the arms of his mother and separate the two, that's wrong. I don't care where you're at, what time and what condition ... That goes against human decency." Earlier in the week, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution affirming that immigrants be treated "with the same respect and dignity as those native born." It emphasized border security but also "a pathway to legal status with appropriate restitutionary measures, maintaining the priority of family unity."  Beyond politicians, pediatricians have also denounced the practice of tearing children away from their parents, saying it can disrupt brain development and harm long-term health. The president attempted to cast the blame away from his administration Friday morning, tweeting, "The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda."No federal law requires family separation. The policy is part of the Justice Department's clampdown on immigration.House Republicans plan to vote next week on a pair of immigration bills, including one that would end the controversial practice of separating children from their mothers and fathers.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor
    Outside contributors' opinions and analysis of the most important issues in politics, science, and culture.
  The Trump administration’s policy to separate parents and children at the border has been met with a mix of outrage and confusion. The government announced the cruel practice on May 7, in a departure from past policies in which families were kept together and only detained for a limited time. The Trump administration decided to work around the time restriction imposed by courts by no longer treating families as units: Parents are detained, and children are “put into foster care or wherever,” in the infamously blasé words of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.As with much of the administration’s actions, it’s difficult to parse how much of this policy is a new moral low for the country and how much of it builds on historical precedent. As is generally the case, the answer is both. The US government has never held families — nonwhite families, anyway — to be sacrosanct. In the late 19th century, for instance, at a moment of particular anxiety about American national identity, the government intervened to separate immigrant and American-Indian children from their parents to mold them into a particular kind of citizen. The difference, though, is that such policies have almost always been rooted in misguided ideas of social uplift and national good. The new moral rot added by the Trump administration is that its policy is entirely punitive.Forced separation of families was, of course, central to the American regime of slavery. In a system that allowed for hereditary enslavement, children were transformed into property at birth.As the system of human trafficking grew over the early 19th century, children were regularly sold away from their families for both economic and punitive reasons. Supporters of slavery dismissed moral arguments against this separation, asserting that black people lacked the emotional capacity to truly feel the pain of losing a child or parent. “Their griefs are transient,” Thomas Jefferson wrote of the enslaved black people who lived and worked with him. “Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether Heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them.”There was no pretense that the separation of slaves was for their benefit. In other cases, though, politicians and reformers excused family separation as part of a broader “civilizing” project. Take the case of American Indians. In the last third of the 19th century, as the US laid claim to the full stretch of the continent, new anxieties emerged about the character of the American people, hemmed in on one side by the closed frontier and on the other by mass immigration from Europe. In the midst of these growing anxieties, the federal government began to shift its relationship to American Indians; only an aggressive program of forced assimilation to American norms and educational practices could make this problematic population truly “American.”In an attempt to break up tribal culture and unity, the Dawes Act of 1887 forced American Indians to abandon communal property for individual family-based farms. At the same time, tens of thousands of Indian children were taken from their families and put into government-funded boarding schools, where they were forced to change their names, learn English, dress in Western-style clothing, and (often) convert to Christianity — all in the name of a civilizing mission, which Richard Henry Pratt, head of the first boarding school, summarized in this way: “Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.” Even as these schools became a subject of criticism and concern in the 20th century, the policy of separation remained. Between the 1950s and 1970s, as many as 25 to 35 percent of American Indian children were taken from their families, with up to 90 percent placed with white households. The decision to place these children with white families is particularly revealing because the norm for adoptions at the time was to place children with families of the same racial or ethnic background, a practice called “matching.” But for American Indian adoptions, children were more likely to be placed outside of Native communities — which, for reasons of poverty and cultural differences, social workers often saw as inappropriate environments for raising children — an extension of the effort to scrub away Native American culture.American Indians weren’t the only ones subject to new forms of government intervention in the family. As mass immigration stirred fears that “American” stock — read: pure white bloodlines — would be diluted, reformers sought ways to intervene in immigrant families. In an era when children were being reimagined as innocents shaped by their environment, reformers believed that the only way to ensure immigrant children would grow up to become good citizens was through strong state intervention. It’s not a coincidence that at the same time the Bureau of Indian Affairs was investing in boarding schools, states began to create child cruelty organizations that were vested with police powers that allowed them to remove children from their homes. That may sound like an unmitigated good — and, in many cases, children were removed from genuinely harmful environments. But such organizations, like the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, mostly run by white Protestant men, regularly confused poverty and cultural differences with abuse. Children could be removed if their parents engaged in acts as mundane as cooking with garlic or drinking wine at dinner. It was part of a new wave of interventions in family life, both benign (mandatory public education) and less so. Many of these reformers were acting out of cultural and racial chauvinism, an assumption that they knew what was in the best interest of the families they were tearing apart. The Trump administration is making no such claims. Their vision of America is not assimiliationist (an idea with its own problems) but exclusionary: making America too cruel for immigrants, including refugees and asylum seekers, to risk crossing the border. But perhaps that cruelty will sharpen for us, in ways that earlier eras obscured, what a tremendous injustice it is to force families apart, and to more fully grapple with our country’s history of doing so in the name of making American great.Nicole Hemmer, a Vox columnist, is the author of Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics. She is an assistant professor at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center and co-host of the Past Present podcast.The Big Idea is Vox’s home for smart discussion of the most important issues and ideas in politics, science, and culture — typically by outside contributors. If you have an idea for a piece, pitch us at thebigidea@vox.com.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.The Department of Justice, under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, is drafting a plan that would totally overhaul asylum policy in the United States.Under the plan, people would be barred from getting asylum if they came into the US between ports of entry and were prosecuted for illegal entry. It would also add presumptions that would make it extremely difficult for Central Americans to qualify for asylum, and codify — in an even more restrictive form — an opinion written by Sessions in June that attempted to restrict asylum for victims of domestic and gang violence.Vox has confirmed that the regulation is in the process of being evaluated, and has seen a copy of a draft of the regulation. When the regulation is ready, it will be published in the Federal Register as a notice of proposed rulemaking, with 90 days for the public to comment before it’s enacted as a final regulation. The version Vox saw may change before it’s finalized, or even before the proposal is published in the Federal Register. (The Department of Justice declined to comment.)But as it exists now, the proposal is a sweeping and thorough revamp of asylum — tightening the screws throughout the asylum process. One source familiar with the asylum process but not authorized to speak on the record described the proposed changes as “the most severe restrictions on asylum since at least 1965” — when the law that created the current legal immigration system was passed — and “possibly even further back.”The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the attorney general, along with the Department of Homeland Security, discretion over asylum standards — saying that the government “may grant asylum” to an applicant who they determine meets the definition of a refugee. But the proposed regulation would make it nearly impossible for Central Americans, including families, to earn the government’s approval.It would eliminate the path that thousands of Central Americans, including families, take every month to seek asylum in the US: entering between ports of entry and presenting themselves to Border Patrol agents. It would make it all but impossible for victims of domestic or gang violence to qualify for asylum — going even further than a June decision from Sessions that sought to limit asylum access for those groups. It would create a presumption against Central Americans who travel through Mexico on their way to the US.What happens under current policy: Under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” initiative, all migrants who cross between ports of entry and are apprehended by Border Patrol are supposed to be criminally prosecuted for illegal entry. That arrest can delay a person’s claim of asylum, but it doesn’t derail it. An asylum-seeker may not get their initial screening interview, which determines whether they’ll be allowed to file an asylum application and get a hearing, until after they’ve been prosecuted and convicted. And they definitely won’t get approved for asylum before their criminal conviction. But the conviction for illegal entry doesn’t affect the asylum claim; as Customs and Border Protection puts it, the two are on “parallel tracks.”What would happen under the new plan: The proposed regulation would bar anyone from getting asylum if they’d been convicted of illegal entry or illegal reentry. That means people who asked for asylum when they were apprehended at the border, but were prosecuted first, would get denied asylum.In effect, under this new regulation, combined with the zero-tolerance prosecution initiative, no one would be able to come to the US and get asylum unless they presented themselves at a port of entry. Many asylum-seekers simply don’t have that option. Smugglers often prevent asylum-seekers from using official ports of entry, and many of those who do come to ports of entry are being forced to wait days or weeks, after being told there’s no room to process them right now. And asylum-seekers who come to ports of entry are often required to stay in immigration detention without bond until their case is complete.The administration would almost certainly get sued over this provision if it ended up included in the finalized regulation. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has the power to bar people from getting asylum (or other forms of relief from deportation) if they’ve committed “particularly serious crimes.” While there’s no definition of seriousness in the law, lawyers and immigration advocates would likely challenge the idea that illegal entry, a misdemeanor, is “particularly serious.” But even if that provision is struck down or eliminated by the courts, another proposal in the draft regulation could have much the same effect. It would instruct immigration judges to consider how the asylum-seeker got into the US, and treat it as a significant factor in whether or not to grant asylum (since asylum-seekers have to show they deserve “favorable discretion” from the judge). So even if people who crossed between ports of entry weren’t officially banned from getting asylum, they would have a very hard time winning their cases in practice.If adopted, the regulation, combined with the zero tolerance initiative, would allow the administration to set up assembly-line justice for asylum seekers, including families, entering the US. People who entered between official ports would be held by the Department of Homeland Security, prosecuted for illegal entry, convicted, then have their asylum applications denied and get deported. While the Trump administration is currently trying to win the power to detain families for more than 20 days, if this regulation were enacted, they might not even need to. They could deny most asylum claims and deport the claimants within that time.What happens under current policy: US law limits asylum to people who are persecuted because of their race, religion, political opinions, nationality, or membership in a particular social group. The government has been wrestling for decades with that last classification — what exactly counts as a “particular social group”? — and with whether someone is “persecuted” if they’re victimized by someone other than the government. These questions are key to the fate of many of the Central Americans (including children and families) who have come to the US to seek asylum in recent years, many of whom are claiming asylum based on domestic violence or gang victimization in their home countries.In June, with a sweeping ruling overturning a case from the Board of Immigration Appeals, Sessions attempted to narrow the circumstances in which someone fleeing domestic or gang violence could qualify for asylum in the US — saying that, generally, victims of domestic or gang violence wouldn’t be eligible for asylum based on their victimization.As I reported last week, though, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has been cautious in implementing Sessions’s opinion. Most notably, while Sessions decreed that his ruling overturned any precedent that contradicted it, USCIS only told asylum officers to stop using the one precedent decision Sessions explicitly named as moot. It looks like the DOJ may be trying to use regulation to accomplish the same goal — with even narrower definitions of “persecuted” and “particular social group.”What would happen under the plan: The proposed regulation would add several restrictions to what could constitute a particular social group: a family, for example, wouldn’t be a social group unless the family had a visible national presence. Interpersonal violence or crime victimization, similarly, wouldn’t be the basis for social group membership unless they were happening on a national scale. Having been recruited by a gang would be explicitly prohibited as grounds for an asylum claim. To qualify for asylum, an applicant would have to show that the people who persecuted her were also persecuting others on the same basis. Human-rights lawyers worry this could disqualify many legitimate asylum claims. One lawyer raises the example of a gay man in Russia who suffers a violent homophobic attack: Under the proposal, “this would not be persecution on account of sexual orientation unless you could prove that these attackers had previously persecuted other gay men.”An asylum-seeker would be required to provide an exact definition of her “particular social group” when she was applying for asylum. And she wouldn’t be allowed to appeal a denial, or reopen a claim, on the basis of any group she hadn’t originally named. It’s extremely difficult for anyone other than a trained immigration lawyer to know exactly what does and doesn’t count as a particular social group eligible for asylum. Under the proposed regulation, however, an asylum-seeker who didn’t know the precise nature of the basis for her persecution would be assumed to not really be a victim of persecution at all.This standard wouldn’t just apply to final approvals or denials of asylum. The initial step for an asylee is what’s called a “credible fear” screening, during which an asylum officer decides whether the person has a credible fear of going back to their home country. The proposed rule would tighten standards for those, too.Immigration lawyers and border advocates were already extremely concerned that Sessions’s May ruling would cause asylum officers to radically hike the standards for passing the screening interview (though the USCIS memo posted by Vox suggests that might not be the case just yet). If this regulation were finalized, however, it seems very possible that many people who are currently given the opportunity to apply for asylum would be turned away before they got the chance.What happens under current policy: Many asylum seekers are Central Americans who come through Mexico to seek asylum in the US. The US is not allowed to simply turn them back and force them to seek asylum in Mexico instead. (The Trump administration is trying to get Mexico to sign a “safe third country” agreement that would allow them to do this, but Mexico appears unenthusiastic.) But the proposed regulation would make it a lot easier to deny their asylum claims based on not having sought asylum in Mexico first.What would happen under the plan: Under the proposed rule, the government would generally withhold “favorable discretion” (and, therefore, deny the asylum claim) for anyone who had spent more than two weeks in another country en route to the US without seeking asylum there, or who had traveled through more than one country on the way to the US.Many Central Americans, especially if they take the train through Mexico or travel on foot, take more than two weeks to travel through Mexico. And asylum-seekers from Honduras and El Salvador cross through Guatemala and Mexico to get to the US — meaning that they would almost certainly not earn the “favorable discretion” required to get their asylum claim approved.The proposed regulation is extremely broad, with a lot more provisions — all of which would make it much harder for people to seek and get asylum. Some of the remaining ideas in the proposed draft include:Limiting appeals for asylum-seekers who fail their screening interviews. Under current law, if an asylum-seeker fails her initial “credible fear” interview with an asylum officer, she can appeal for a judge to review her claim with fresh eyes — ignoring the fact that the asylum officer hadn’t found it a credible claim. Under the proposed regulation, judges would only be able to approve a credible-fear claim on appeal if there was clear evidence that the asylum officer had screwed up.Rejecting incomplete applications first and letting them get completed later. Instead of returning incomplete asylum applications to the applicant and asking her to complete it, the government would reject the application. The applicant would still have 60 days to complete and resubmit the application before it was officially denied, but it’s not clear how applicants would be told about that — or whether they’d read beyond the word “rejected.”Allowing judges to put evidence into the record on their own. The proposal would allow immigration judges considering asylum cases to unilaterally insert any information from credible sources into the record (as long as both the prosecutor and defense were informed). This provision would make it much easier for judges to insert information claiming that an asylum-seeker’s home country isn’t as dangerous for him as he claims — since asylum cases often hinge on whether there’s anywhere safe in the home country the asylum-seeker could live instead of the US.Immigrants could be barred from asylum based on traffic offenses... In addition to the new prohibitions on asylum for immigration-specific crimes, the regulation would ban any applicant who’d been convicted of two or three misdemeanors (depending on what they were) from getting asylum. This would have the biggest impact on unauthorized immigrants living in the US who get arrested and put in deportation proceedings, but ask for asylum to avert their deportation. (Under asylum law, someone can ask for asylum at any point within their first year of living in the US.) In immigration policy, traffic offenses like driving without a license often don’t count as misdemeanors because in many states unauthorized immigrants aren’t allowed to get licenses. But the draft regulation makes clear that if driving without a license is a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction in question, it counts toward ineligibility....and blue states can’t fix eligibility by expunging immigrants’ records. Some Democratic state officials (most notably Gov. Jerry Brown in California) have started to use the pardon power to clear the criminal records of immigrants facing deportation. This regulation would do an end-run around that strategy. Convictions that had been expunged or otherwise modified after the fact would still count as convictions if there was any evidence that the criminal record had been altered for immigration purposes. In other words, if Brown tried to expunge a record to make someone eligible for asylum, the fact that that’s why he did it would prevent it from stopping their deportation.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.Home » Issues » Immigration Enforcement » The Orantes InjunctionMARCH 2011The Orantes injunction is a nationwide, permanent injunction that requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to uphold certain rights of Salvadoran nationals in immigration detention.In 1982, a U.S. district court issued a preliminary injunction based on evidence that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) had detained and removed Salvadoran nationals eligible for asylum by using coercive tactics. Among other practices, the court found that there was evidence that INS provided misleading information to Salvadoran detainees regarding their right to apply for political asylum, denied Salvadoran detainees adequate access to counsel and to information about their rights, and placed Salvadoran detainees into solitary confinement without an administrative hearing.[1] After a lengthy trial, the court in 1988 entered a permanent nationwide injunction mandating that the INS provide Salvadorans placed in immigration custody with a written notice about their rights, ensure Salvadorans access to telephones, counsel, and legal materials in detention, and refrain from coercing Salvadorans into signing voluntary departure agreements.[2]In 2005, the government moved to dissolve the Orantes injunction, arguing that intervening changes in law and fact made the injunction’s protections unnecessary. In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California denied nearly all of the government’s motion to dissolve the injunction, finding that the government had failed to show significantly changed conditions for Salvadoran detainees to warrant dissolving the injunction, and modified the injunction only slightly. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld this decision in 2009.[3] As a result, the injunction remains in force today and the government must abide by the terms of the modified permanent injunction nationwide.A copy of the modified permanent injunction is available at www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/orantes_modified_injunction_2007-11-26.pdfThe Orantes injunction applies to citizens and nationals of El Salvador who are eligible to apply for political asylum, and who have been, are, or will be taken into custody by agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).[4] The detainee does not need to have applied for asylum in order for the injunction to apply. Although the Orantes injunction does not apply to immigrant detainees from other countries, several of its requirements effectively benefit all detainees in immigration detention. Enforcement of the injunction, however, must take place on behalf of a Salvadoran detainee.The Orantes injunction requires that DHS provide the following to Salvadoran detainees:The National Immigration Law Center is documenting violations of the injunction to advocate for better conditions in immigration detention and to instruct the government to correct any violations.

HolderAbout U.S. obligations to detained unaccompanied immigrant childrenPresident Trump called some people “animals” during an immigration roundtable with California sheriffs on May 16.  Who you believe he was referring to probably depends on how you feel about President Trump. Trump and the White House claim it’s clear as day: Trump was obviously referring to MS-13 gang members who commit heinous crimes. Trump’s called MS-13 “animals” before, but after this controversy the White House has embraced the term: a Monday press release was titled “What You Need To Know About The Animals Of MS-13.”MS-13 “animals” has gone from a presidential utterance to White House doctrine. This WH press release on “what you need to know about the violent animals of MS-13” calls them animals 8 times. pic.twitter.com/ZAfOlYjaDBBut in the eyes of Trump’s critics, the justification for “animals” wasn’t obvious at all. Some believe that the president simply had an obligation to be more careful with his words, while others point to a long history of using a few criminals to smear entire groups of people — or simply claim that it’s inhumane to refer to any human being as an animal.At this point, both sides think they’ve won. Trump and the White House are messaging the idea that MS-13 is a bunch of animals in the aggressive manner they use when they think they’ve found a winning culture-war argument (see also: “Merry Christmas”). Meanwhile, Democrats and advocates appear to believe that they have another remark on their hands that will pay political dividends by revealing the president’s true animosity toward people of color (see also: “shithole countries”). Both sides believe that the other is missing, or deliberately blocking out, the context of Trump’s remark. It’s an intractable disagreement not because the immediate context is unknowable — the whole event was broadcast live — but because Donald Trump has spent his entire three years in national politics saying things that sound racist to a lot of people, and America has spent three years arguing about whether that’s the fault of the person speaking those words or the people hearing them.

  The original wave of progressive outrage over Trump’s comments, on Wednesday, was spurred by tweets like this one, which quoted Trump’s “animals” comment but not the comment from the sheriff that preceded it:Trump: "We're taking people out of the country — you wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals."He says the U.S. has "the dumbest laws on immigration in the world."That outrage spurred characterization of Trump’s comments as being about all deportees or even about all unauthorized immigrants. Trump’s defenders immediately claimed the media was getting the story wrong — that Trump had been answering a question about MS-13, so he clearly meant only that violent MS-13 gang members were “criminals.”Both of those characterizations were wrong. This is a pasted selection from the transcript sent out by the White House Press Office after the roundtable Wednesday:SHERIFF (Margaret) MIMS (Fresno County, CA): Now ICE is the only law enforcement agency that cannot use our databases to find the bad guys. They cannot come in and talk to people in our jail, unless they reach a certain threshold. They can’t do all kinds of things that other law enforcement agencies can do. And it’s really put us in a very bad position.THE PRESIDENT: It’s a disgrace. Okay? It’s a disgrace.SHERIFF MIMS: It’s a disgrace.THE PRESIDENT: And we’re suing on that, and we’re working hard, and I think it will all come together, because people want it to come together. It’s so ridiculous. The concept that we’re even talking about is ridiculous. We’ll take care of it, Margaret. We’ll win.SHERIFF MIMS: Thank you. There could be an MS-13 member I know about — if they don’t reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about it.THE PRESIDENT: We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It’s crazy.This context makes a few things clear.First of all, Trump was not asked a question about MS-13. He was not asked a question at all. He was commiserating with Sheriff Mims about the restrictions that the California “sanctuary” law puts on the ability of local law enforcement officers to make decisions about when someone should be flagged to ICE.Second of all, the context in which MS-13 was mentioned was itself very specific: someone identified by the sheriff’s department as a “known” gang member but who doesn’t meet the “threshold” of being charged with or convicted of a serious crime. Third, Trump’s response to Mims’s comment wasn’t actually a response to the point she was making. It wasn’t about people in local jails in the US. He first referred to people “trying to come in” to the country and then to people who are being “taken out of the country.” He then launched into a complaint about bad US laws that allow people to reenter the country repeatedly — something that also has nothing to do with the complaint Mims was making.In context, Trump’s “animals” comment was simply part of a riff; something at best tangentially related to the conversation that he and Mims had been having up to that point. That riff may well have been inspired by Mims’s reference to MS-13 in her previous remark. At the same time, though, Trump manifestly wasn’t talking about the same people Mims was talking about: MS-13 members in American jails without serious criminal records. The president often does this. His comments in unscripted settings often fail to follow any obvious train of thought; he often goes off on tangents and rehashes old riffs; he often fails to demonstrate an understanding of the actual policies being discussed. This is why “what did he mean” is so often an open question. But because he’s the president of the United States, ambiguous statements can’t be left ambiguous — they’re going to acquire whatever meaning people can make from them, based on their existing understanding of what kind of person the president is.To people who are more skeptical of the “mainstream media” than they are of the president, the coverage of the president’s remarks seemed like a clear-cut case of “fake news” — reporters taking Trump’s words out of context to make him sound like a racist when he was in fact talking about violent criminals. “I don’t think the term the president used was strong enough,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. “It took an animal to stab a man 100 times and decapitate him and cut his heart out.” And it inspired a wave of fact-checking and finger-wagging from media reporters themselves.The Trump critics who were initially outraged about Trump’s “animals” comment, however, see this entire conversation about the context of Wednesday’s exchange as more or less missing the point.They believe that Trump has shown a willingness to use racist language in the past and has demonstrated that he believes some people of color aren’t really human. Those facts, they believe, are more relevant context than what Sheriff Mims said at the roundtable. And they believe that in that context, it is foolish or even dangerous to present the “animals” remark as if there’s any ambiguity.This is the debate that has defined Donald Trump’s political career. His very first speech as a presidential candidate made a riffing reference to rapists and murderers crossing into the US, spurring outrage from immigrants and progressives that the president had called Mexicans and immigrants “criminals.” Trump gleefully exploited the outrage and parlayed it into a surge in the primary polls. Ever since, his most frequent and enthusiastic rhetorical theme has been that Americans are in danger from criminals coming into the US, and that his particular immigration agenda is the best way to stop them. This is why he keeps talking about MS-13; this is why he keeps dwelling on a few particularly gory crimes and calling the gang “animals.”Trump critics accuse him of labeling all immigrants (or all Latinos) criminals; his critics’ critics counter that he isn’t explicitly talking about all immigrants or all Latinos and that it’s liberals who think nonracial comments are about race.Every iteration of this fight encourages both sides’ viewpoints. It encourages Trump’s defenders — and those who are anti-anti-Trump — to believe that Trump’s words are being taken out of context to suit a preexisting narrative. It encourages Trump’s critics to believe that the president is deliberately engaging in dog-whistle politics because he knows exactly where the line is and how to tiptoe over it without admitting to doing so.The Trump administration won the public argument about whether Trump was, at least ostensibly, referring to MS-13 members. But that doesn’t resolve the argument over whether it was morally okay for him to do that.Indeed, to those who believe the most important point is that no one should ever be described as subhuman, attempts to explain the context of Trump’s remarks were seen as attempts to justify the dehumanization of some people as long as they’re accused of being in a gang. It feels pretty weird watching folks on this website debate who should and shouldn't be described as less than human by the president.On one level, this is a sheer argument of deontological ethics: All people are possessed of innate human dignity, and no act they commit can strip that of them or justify other people acting toward them as if they do not possess it. Most codes of ethics don’t allow people to treat others badly just because they have done bad things. Christianity makes a virtue of mercy and has its messiah tell a mob they are morally unfit to stone an adulteress (a violator of one of the Ten Commandments!) unless they are wholly without sin.On another level, though, this is an instrumental argument that dehumanizing anyone leads to bad outcomes. An entire academic literature is dedicated to the pernicious effects of dehumanizing language; an oversimplified version of that literature, often expressed during the “animals” debate, is that dehumanization of a particular scapegoat group is a necessary component of totalitarian rhetoric. (The implication was often that comments like Trump’s are always a precursor to genocidal violence, which doesn’t hold logically.) More specifically, as criminologist John Pfaff pointed out, a willingness to accept criminals as subhuman encourages law enforcement officers to treat them accordingly, with often horrific results.The people making this argument weren’t primarily Democratic politicians. But after a day or so of the animals debate, Republicans had shifted to the idea that they had jiujitsued liberals into defending MS-13, and that that would help them in November. This, too, is a fixture of dialogue in the age of Trump: even people who wouldn’t defend his statements on the merits believe that they create an advantageous political situation for his party by inspiring the other side to do something politically counterproductive.It seems logical that MS-13 is inherently a winning issue for Trump and a losing one for Democrats (though it’s worth noting that in the one post-Trump race where the tie between immigration and crime was central to the campaign, the Virginia gubernatorial election, the Democrat won).But it’s another example of people talking past each other. No one is saying that it is politically useful to adopt the message of “Trump was just talking about violent MS-13 criminals, but they are people too.” Trump’s critics are either emphasizing that it is true that MS-13 members are also human beings or making the argument that Trump doesn’t really just mean MS-13 members when he says “animals.”The problem with fighting about whom Trump meant when he said what he said is that, on a policy level, what he said does not actually matter.His administration is not focusing on deporting people who have committed particularly heinous crimes, gang members, or people with criminal records. From Trump’s inauguration to the end of 2017, ICE arrested 45,436 immigrants without criminal records.On Thursday, in the midst of the furor over the “animals” comments, ICE released new data for the first three months of 2018 — showing that an additional 13,300 immigrants without criminal records were arrested from January to March.To be sure, ICE arrests of immigrants with criminal records ticked up slightly from the last year of the Obama administration (in which immigration enforcement was subdued compared to previous years) to the Trump administration. But arrests of immigrants without criminal records have also spiked. During President Obama’s last year, about 16 percent of ICE arrests were of noncriminal immigrants; each month since July 2017, between 32 and 40 percent of arrestees have been noncriminals.The Trump administration is still deporting fewer noncriminal immigrants than the Obama administration did circa 2011, and the proportion of deportees who are noncriminals is usually smaller than the proportion of arrestees who are. But the Trump administration is aiming to not just ramp back up to the deportation peak of Obama’s first term but surpass it, and that’s going to require arresting and deporting a lot of immigrants without criminal records.If Trump understands his own administration’s policy, he’s never acknowledged it in public. He sticks to the same rhetorical move every time: refer to some specific criminals, call them horrible people and animals, say that their evil justifies his immigration policy, and allow the conflation of all immigrants and all Latinos with criminals and animals to remain subtext.This isn’t unique to Trump. An entire era of American criminal justice policy was defined by this rhetorical move: Politicians attacked each other over horrific cases of leniency gone wrong, or with the threat of child “superpredators” roaming the streets, and the fear of those “worst of the worst” criminals led to policies that swept millions of people into the criminal justice system.As Trump has amped up his rhetoric about MS-13, local and federal law enforcement officials have started rounding up immigrant teens on the basis of suspected gang membership — no matter how dubious those claims are. In a 2017 feature about MS-13 and Long Island’s immigrant community, Jonathan Blitzer of the New Yorker says that one Long Island teen was arrested in a gang sweep for having a Salvadoran flag as his profile picture (whose dominant color, bright blue, is also used by MS-13). One ex-girlfriend of a gang member told Blitzer that when they needed to lie low, “Carlos and his friends from MS-13 would change their style of dress” — like swapping out their shoes — and then “mocked the police for being slow to catch on” to the fact that they weren’t wearing their “characteristic” gang attire. “Immigrant teens without ties to the gang,” meanwhile, were at risk: They “didn’t necessarily know which clothes were off limits.”In one high-profile case from 2017, ICE agents made several attempts to strip protections from an immigrant covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by claiming he was a gang member; the immigrant, however, claims that the ICE agents falsified a document to make it look like he admitted to being in a gang (and federal judges have believed him).These things don’t just happen because Donald Trump uses the word “animals.” But they don’t get the attention that Trump’s words do. And while plenty of people are willing to defend calling gang members “animals,” few are interested in looking at whether the immigration enforcement system as it exists draws the clear distinction they claim to have heard from Trump.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.The story of the first generation Ghanian-American student accepted by all eight Ivy league schools is wonderful, but it also stirs up the tension between black Americans and recent African immigrants — especially when you describe him as "not a typical African-American kid." This article is from the archive of our partner .The story of the first-generation Ghanian-American student accepted by all eight Ivy league schools is wonderful, but it also stirs up the tension between black Americans and recent African immigrants — especially when you describe him as "not a typical African-American kid." That's been the reaction to USA Today's profile on Kwasi Enin, a Long Island high schooler who got into the nation's most competitive schools through hard work and, according to IvyWise CEO Katherine Cohen, being African (and being male). At one point the piece reads:Being a first-generation American from Ghana also helps him stand out, Cohen says. "He's not a typical African-American kid.""Not a typical African-American kid" is being read as an allusion to the lazy black American stereotype. The tension comes from the fact that some African immigrants buy into that stereotype, which gets turned into "Africans don't like black people." This has almost nothing to do with Enin, who is obviously a remarkable young man, and everything to do with how America perceives and portrays black Americans and African immigrants. In January, Luvvie Ajayi, a Nigerian-born immigrant, tried to explain "akata," a word some Nigerians use to refer to black Americans that translates into wild animal. (Note: A lot of Nigerians use akata to mean "ghetto" as well. My mom once told me I was dressed like an akata girl because I wanted to wear sweatpants in public.) She argued in a series of tweets, collected by Clutch, that the reason some Africans believe black Americans should be doing better is because they don't know about the history of black Americans but see their own success as a reason blacks should excel as well. "Africans who come to the U.S. are statistically more successful than African Americans and they think 'if I could do it, why not them?'" she wrote. American society holds that same view as well. A 2007 study covered by the Washington Post found that a quarter of black students admitted to elite colleges were African immigrants, though they only represented 13 percent of America's college-age black population. The study's authors several theories on why black immigrants do better, including "to white observers black immigrants seem more polite, less hostile, more solicitous and 'easier to get along with.' Native blacks are perceived in precisely the opposite fashion." Lani Guinier, a Harvard professor, argued instead that schools were attempting to "resolve historic wrongs against native black Americans by enrolling immigrants who look like them" but had different experiences. "In part, it has to do with coming from a country ... where blacks were in the majority and did not experience the stigma that black children did in the United States," Guinier said. Either explanation creates a divide — as if Africans can only succeed at the expense of black Americans, or vice versa.This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.We want to hear what you think about this article.

We will work with our friends in the Senate, and we have started working with our friends in the House as well.”  View the discussion thread.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ©2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp., a subsidiary of News Communications, Inc.

The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. (Photo: Thomas Dwyer)Immigration seems to be ever present in current political and public debate in the United States, with the topic central in the 2016 presidential campaign and since then, amid ongoing policy conversations about border wall construction, refugee resettlement cuts, family separation, and much more. Yet even as positions taken by political parties and individuals seem hardened, immigration flows and the makeup of the U.S. immigrant population have been changing in significant, though not always fully appreciated, ways.Among the changes: The overall immigrant population continues to grow, but at a slower rate than before the 2007-09 recession. Recent immigrants are more likely to be from Asia than from Mexico, and are also more likely to have a college degree. The size of the unauthorized population appears to be on the decline. Deportations from within the United States are rising. And the United States in 2018 resettled the smallest number of refugees since formal creation of the refugee resettlement program in 1980.To help inform discussions around immigration, this Spotlight offers in one accessible resource the most authoritative, unbiased, and current data available about the 44.5 million immigrants resident in the United States as of 2017. By compiling some of the most frequently requested facts and figures, this article provides answers to questions such as: What are the trends shaping immigration to our country? How many people have immigrated to the United States, and via what channels? How many arrived as refugees, and from which countries? Has the number of unauthorized immigrants changed in recent years? What jobs do immigrants fill? And how many U.S. residents are either immigrants or the children of immigrants?The article draws on the most recent resources and data from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI); the U.S. Census Bureau (using its 2017 American Community Survey [ACS], 2018 Current Population Survey [CPS], and 2000 decennial census); and the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and State. (Note: DHS and State Department data refer to fiscal years that begin on October 1 and end on September 30; ACS and CPS data refer to calendar years). For more detailed information on U.S. and global immigration data sources and one-click access to these datasets, see the MPI report Immigration Data Matters.Click on the bullet points for more information on each topic:How many immigrants reside in the United States?More than 44.5 million immigrants resided in the United States in 2017, the historical high since census records have been kept. One in seven U.S. residents is foreign born, according to 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) data. While immigrants’ current share—13.7 percent—of the overall U.S. population (325.7 million people) has been increasing since the record low marked in 1970, it remains below the historical record of 14.8 percent hit in 1890.Between 2016 and 2017, the foreign-born population increased by about 787,000, or almost 2 percent—a rate higher than the 1 percent growth experienced between 2015 and 2016, but lower than the 3 percent increase between 2013 and 2014.How have the number and share of immigrants changed over time?Data on the nativity of the U.S. population was first collected in the 1850 census. That year, there were 2.2 million immigrants, representing nearly 10 percent of the overall population.Between 1860 and 1920, the immigrant share fluctuated between 13 percent and almost 15 percent of the overall population, peaking at 14.8 percent in 1890, largely due to high levels of immigration from Europe.Restrictive immigration laws in 1921 and 1924—which kept the channels to permanent immigration open almost exclusively to northern and western European immigrants—coupled with the Great Depression and World War II, led to a sharp drop in new arrivals from the Eastern Hemisphere. The foreign-born share steadily declined, hitting a record low of 4.7 percent in 1970 (9.6 million; see Figure 1).Since then, the share and number of immigrants have increased rapidly, mainly because of large-scale immigration from Latin America and Asia, with the foreign-born population standing at 44.5 million as of 2017. Important shifts in U.S. immigration law (including the Immigration Act of 1965 that abolished national-origin admission quotas, the Refugee Act of 1980, and preferential treatment of Cuban immigrants); the United States’ growing economic and military presence in Asia and Latin America; economic ties, powerful immigrant networks, and deep migration history between the United States and its southern neighbors; and major economic transformations and political instability in countries around the world all have helped usher in the vast diversification of immigration flows.Figure 1. Size and Share of the Foreign-Born Population in the United States, 1850-2017Source: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau, 2010-17 American Community Surveys (ACS), and 1970, 1990, and 2000 Decennial Census. All other data are from Campbell J. Gibson and Emily Lennon, "Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-Born Population of the United States: 1850 to 1990" (Working Paper no. 29., U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 1999).Definitions"Foreign born" and "immigrant" are used interchangeably and refer to persons with no U.S. citizenship at birth. This population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, persons on certain temporary visas, and the unauthorized.Geographical regions: MPI follows the definition of Latin America as put forth by the United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau, which spans Central America (including Mexico), the Caribbean, and South America. For more information about geographical regions, see the U.S. Census Bureau and United Nations Statistics Division.How do today’s top countries of origin compare to those 50 years ago?In 2017, Mexicans accounted for approximately 25 percent of immigrants in the United States, making them by far the largest foreign-born group. Indians and Chinese (including immigrants from Hong Kong but not Taiwan) were the next two largest groups, each comprising close to 6 percent, followed by Filipinos at 5 percent. Rounding out the top ten were El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic (about 3 percent each); and South Korea and Guatemala (approximately 2 percent). Together, these countries were the origin for 57 percent of the U.S. immigrant population in 2017.The predominance of Latin American and Asian immigration in the late 20th and early 21st centuries starkly contrasts with the trend in the mid-1900s, when immigrants were largely European. In the 1960s no single country accounted for more than 15 percent of the total immigrant population. Italians were the top origin group, making up 13 percent of the foreign born in 1960, followed by Germans and Canadians (about 10 percent each).How many immigrants have entered the United States since 2010, and what are the leading sending countries?Twenty-one percent of the 44.5 million immigrants in the United States in 2017 entered in 2010 or later, 26 percent arrived between 2000 and 2009, 22 percent between 1990 and 1999, and 31 percent before 1990.While immigrants from Mexico dominated the flows post-1970, the makeup of newcomers has changed since the 2007-09 recession. Recently arrived immigrants are more likely to come from Asia, with India and China leading the way. Countries such as the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela have also seen sizeable emigration to the United States. By contrast, there were fewer Mexican immigrants in the United States in 2017 than in 2010, representing the biggest decline of all immigrant groups.How many U.S. residents are of recent immigrant origin?Immigrants and their U.S.-born children now number approximately 89.4 million people, or 28 percent of the overall U.S. population, according to the 2018 Current Population Survey (CPS). Pew Research Center projects that the immigrant-origin share will rise to about 36 percent by 2065.DefinitionsCollege-educated persons are defined as adults 25 years and older with a bachelor's degree or higher.The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects the race or races with which individuals most closely self-identify. Race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.Hispanic and Latino are ethnic, not racial, categories. They include individuals who classified themselves in one of the specific Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino categories listed on the Census 2000 questionnaire—"Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban"—as well as those who indicate that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."Persons who indicated that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino" include those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people who self-identify more generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on.Read more about Census Bureau definitions here.What is the median age for immigrants?Overall, the immigrant population in 2017 was older than the U.S.-born population, with a median age of 44.8 years as compared to 36.2 years for the native born. The latter are younger largely because most children of immigrants are born in the United States and a significant share are under age 18.In 2017, fewer than 1 percent of immigrants were under age 5 (compared to 7 percent for the native born), approximately 5 percent were ages 5 to 17 (versus 18 percent), 79 percent were ages 18 to 64 (compared to 59 percent), and 16 percent were ages 65 and older (the same as the U.S. born).What is the female share of the immigrant population?
In 2017, approximately 52 percent of immigrants were female. The share has fluctuated slightly over the past four decades; women accounted for 53 percent of immigrants in 1980, 51 percent in 1990, 50 percent in 2000, and 51 percent in 2010.What is the racial makeup of immigrants?Forty-six percent of immigrants in 2017 reported their race as single-race White, 27 percent as Asian, 9 percent as Black, and 16 percent as some other race. About 2 percent reported having two or more races.How many immigrants are Hispanic or Latino?In 2017, 44 percent of U.S. immigrants (19.7 million people) reported having Hispanic or Latino origins.Note: The Census Bureau classifies Hispanic and Latino as ethnic categories, separate from the racial categories listed above (see Definitions box for more information).How many Hispanics in the United States are immigrants?The majority of U.S. Hispanics are native born. Of the 58.8 million people in 2017 who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, 34 percent (19.7 million) were immigrants and 66 percent (39.1 million) were native-born.Which languages are most frequently spoken at home?In 2017, approximately 78 percent (239.3 million) of the 306 million people ages 5 and older in the United States reported speaking only English at home.The remaining 22 percent (66.5 million) reported speaking a language other than English at home. Of the top languages, Spanish was by far the most common (62 percent), followed by Chinese (5 percent, including Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog (almost 3 percent), and Vietnamese, Arabic, French (including Cajun), and Korean (about 2 percent each). The remaining languages in the top 15 each accounted for approximately 1 percent: Russian, German, Haitian Creole, Hindi, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, and Urdu.What percentage of immigrants are Limited English Proficient?In 2017, approximately 48 percent (21.2 million) of 44.2 million immigrants ages 5 and older were Limited English Proficient (LEP).Immigrants account for 82 percent of all LEP individuals over age 5, while native-born individuals account for 18 percent.Note: The term "Limited English Proficient" refers to persons ages 5 and older who reported speaking English "not at all," "not well," or "well" on their survey questionnaire. Individuals who reported speaking “only English” or speaking English "very well" are considered proficient in English.What share of the immigrant population has a college education?In 2017, 31 percent (12 million) of the 39 million immigrants ages 25 and older had a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 32 percent of U.S.-born adults (see Figure 2). Notably, the share of college-educated immigrants was much higher—47 percent—among those who entered the country in the previous five years (between 2012 and 2017).Figure 2. Educational Attainment of U.S.-Born, Immigrant, and Recently Arrived Immigrant Residents, 2017Source: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS.Educational attainment varies by country of origin. In 2017, the top five countries of origin for immigrants with a bachelor’s degree or more were India (79 percent), Taiwan (72 percent), Egypt (68 percent), Latvia (67 percent), and Kuwait (65 percent).Which states have the largest number of immigrants and which ones have experienced the fastest growth of their immigrant populations?In 2017, the top five U.S. states by number of immigrants were California (10.7 million), Texas (4.9 million), New York (4.5 million), Florida (4.4 million), and New Jersey (2.1 million).When classified by the share of immigrants out of the total state population, the top five states in 2017 were California (27 percent), New York (23 percent), New Jersey (23 percent), Florida (21 percent), and Nevada (20 percent).While traditional immigrant destinations lead in terms of absolute number of new immigrants, other states have seen much larger relative growth in their immigrant populations (see Table 1).Table 1. Top Five States by Absolute and Percent Growth in Immigrant Population, 1990-2000 and 2000-17Note: In some states, the initial foreign-born population was quite small. Thus, relatively small absolute increases in the immigrant population in these states have translated into high percent growthSource: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS and 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census.Definitions"Civilian labor force"—civilian persons ages 16 and older who were either employed or unemployed but looking for work in the week prior to participation in the American Community Survey or decennial census.How many immigrants are in the U.S. civilian labor force?Immigrants accounted for 17 percent (28 million) of the 163.7 million persons in the civilian labor force in 2017. Between 1970 and 2017, the percentage of the foreign born in the labor force more than tripled, from 5 percent to 17 percent. Over the same period, the foreign-born share of the total population grew more slowly: from less than 5 percent to just under 14 percent.What types of jobs do immigrants hold?Of the 26.8 million employed foreign-born workers ages 16 and older in 2017, the largest share, more than 32 percent, worked in management, professional, and related occupations. See Figure 3 for other occupations.Figure 3. Employed Workers in the Civilian Labor Force (ages 16 and older), by Nativity and Occupation, 2017Note: Numbers may not add up to 100 as they are rounded to the nearest whole number.Source: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS.What share of immigrants have health insurance?In 2017, approximately 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance (compared to 69 percent of the U.S. born), and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage (compared to 36 percent of the native born).Since implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, health insurance coverage has improved for both the U.S. born and immigrants. From 2013 to 2017, the immigrant uninsured rate fell from 32 percent to 20 percent, and the rate for the native born fell from 12 percent to 7 percent.Note: Health insurance coverage is calculated only for the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Since some people may simultaneously hold both private and public health insurance coverage, estimates of those with public health insurance and those with public coverage may overlap. Their sum therefore may be greater than the total number of people with health insurance.Definitions"Second-generation immigrant children"—any U.S.-born child with at least one foreign-born parent. 
"First-generation immigrant children"—any foreign-born child with at least one foreign-born parent. 
"Child with immigrant parents"—both first- and second-generation immigrant children. Note: The estimates in this section include only children under age 18 who reside with at least one parent.How many U.S. children live with immigrant parents?In 2017, approximately 18.2 million children under age 18 lived with at least one immigrant parent. They accounted for 26 percent of the 70 million children under age 18 in the United States, up from 13 percent in 1990 and 19 percent in 2000.Second-generation children—born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent—accounted for 88 percent (16 million) of all children under age 18 with immigrant parents. The remaining 12 percent (2.2 million) were born outside the United States.How has the number of children in immigrant families changed over time?Between 1990 and 2000, the number of children ages 17 and under with immigrant parents grew 60 percent, from 8.2 million to 13.1 million. Between 2000 and 2017, the number grew by another 39 percent, from 13.1 million to 18.2 million.The population of first-generation immigrant children grew by 43 percent between 1990 and 2000 (from 1.9 million to 2.7 million), but then declined 19 percent between 2000 and 2017 (from 2.7 million to 2.2 million).In contrast, the number of second-generation immigrant children has grown steadily since 1990. Between 1990 and 2000, the number increased by 65 percent (from 6.3 million to 10.4 million). Between 2000 and 2017, this population grew 54 percent (from 10.4 million to almost 16 million).How many children living with immigrant parents are in low-income families?In 2017, there were 27.4 million children under age 18 living in low-income families (i.e., with family incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold). Of them, 8.8 million (or 32 percent) were children of immigrants.Which states have the largest number of children in immigrant families and which ones have experienced the fastest growth of this population?In 2017, the top five states by the total number of children under age 18 living with immigrant parents were California (4.1 million), Texas (2.5 million), New York (1.5 million), Florida (1.4 million), and New Jersey (767,000). These states accounted for 56 percent of the 18.2 million children with immigrant parents residing in the United States.In terms of the share of children with immigrant parents, the top five states in 2017 were California (48 percent of all children in the state), New Jersey (40 percent), Nevada (38 percent), New York (37 percent), and Texas (35 percent).While traditional immigrant destinations experience the largest absolute growth in children with immigrant parents, other states have seen much larger relative growth (see Table 2).Table 2. Top Five States by Absolute and Percent Growth in Children with Immigrant Parents, 1990-2000 and 2000-17Note: In some states, the initial number of children with immigrant parents was quite small. Thus, relatively small absolute increases in the immigrant population in these states have translated into high percent growth.Source: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS and 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census.How many immigrants obtained lawful permanent residence (aka getting a green card) in 2017?In fiscal year (FY) 2017, 1.1 million immigrants became lawful permanent residents (LPRs), also known as green-card holders. The number of new LPRs in 2017 decreased by 5 percent from 2016 (1.2 million). In the past decade, the number of new LPRs annually has ranged from 991,000 (2013) to 1.2 million (2016).In recent years, green-card holders have been roughly evenly divided between those already living in the United States who are adjusting their status and those applying from outside the country. Almost half (49 percent, or 549,000) of the 1.1 million new LPRs in 2017 received green cards from within the United States. Many of these new permanent residents are spouses, minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens; or persons who arrived as refugees or as temporary workers.A slightly higher number of new LPRs (578,000, or 51 percent) were persons granted this status from abroad. The share of new arrivals rose steadily in the past decade from 41-42 percent in 2008-09, to 46-47 percent in 2013-14, and surpassing 50 percent in 2016. The majority of new arrivals are immediate family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs.Under which categories are permanent immigrants admitted?There are four main pathways to obtain a green card: through a family relationship, employment sponsorship, humanitarian protection (refugees and asylees), and the Diversity Visa (DV) lottery.Overall, of the 1.1 million immigrants who received green cards in 2017, 46 percent were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens (immediate relatives have unlimited annual visas), followed by another 21 percent of family-related immigrants (whose admission is limited by visa and country caps).Thirteen percent adjusted from refugee or asylee status. About 12 percent of LPRs were either sponsored by their employers or were able to self-sponsor, including investors. Roughly 5 percent were diversity lottery winners.What are the top five countries of birth for new permanent immigrants in 2017?The top five countries of birth were Mexico (15 percent), mainland China and Cuba (6 percent each), and India and the Dominican Republic (5 percent each). These countries represented about 38 percent of all persons who received green cards in 2017.How many people are selected in the Diversity Visa lottery and where do they come from?In 2017, 51,600 people received green cards as diversity immigrants (from countries with low rates of immigration), representing approximately 5 percent of the 1.1 million new LPRs.The leading countries of birth of DV immigrants were Nepal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Egypt, which each accounted for about 6 percent of DV immigrants; followed by Ethiopia, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Albania, with 5 percent each.For some countries, the diversity visa lottery represents a major share of all new LPRs. For example, among Algerians who received a green card in 2017, 62 percent did so via the green-card lottery. Shares were also high for Uzbekistan (58 percent) and Tajikistan (56 percent) and represented between 40 and 50 percent of LPRs born in Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Togo, Sudan, Benin, and Moldova.Created in 1990, the lottery sets aside 55,000 diversity visas annually, of which 5,000 must be used for applicants under the Nicaraguan and Central America Relief Act of 1997. Interest in the lottery is significantly higher than there are available visas: About 14.7 million qualified applications were registered for the DV-2018, in total covering 23.1 million applicants, their spouses, and their minor children. The number registering in the DV-2018 was 61 percent higher than the 9.2 million registered for the DV-2009. (The application number varies each year depending on which countries are eligible.) Before receiving permission to immigrate, lottery winners must provide proof of a high school education or its equivalent or show two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience. They also must pass a medical exam and a background check.How many people have temporary visas?According to the most recently available Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates at the time of this writing, 2.3 million immigrants on various temporary visas resided in the United States during 2016, up from about 2 million in 2015. Almost half (1,100,000) were temporary workers and their families, followed by 870,000 foreign students and their families (40 percent).Sixty-one percent were from Asia. Nationals of countries in Europe and North America accounted for 15 percent each. The top five countries of origin—India, China, Mexico, Canada, and South Korea—accounted for 57 percent of all residents on temporary visas.Note: This estimate of temporary visa holders includes temporary workers, international students, exchange visitors, diplomats, and representatives of foreign governments and international organizations. It excludes tourists and other short-term visitors. North America includes Canada, Bermuda, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.How many people entered the United States on nonimmigrant visas? In 2016, 42.7 million individuals entered the United States as I-94 nonimmigrants on various temporary visas. On average, each I-94 nonimmigrant was admitted 1.8 times. This is the first time the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) estimated the number of unique individuals who came temporarily, as opposed to the number of nonimmigrant admissions or entries.Most of these nonimmigrants, 34.2 million, entered as tourists, followed by 3.7 million business visitors. Of these, 15 million tourists and 1.7 million business travelers were from Visa Waiver countries. Further, 1 million international students entered on F-1 visas. OIS estimated that additionally about 290,300 individuals were admitted on high-skilled worker H-1B visas (mostly from India, China, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Mexico) and 81,600 on nonagricultural temporary or seasonal worker H-2B visas (mostly from Mexico, Jamaica, Guatemala, South Africa, and Canada).How many nonimmigrant visas does the State Department issue?In FY 2018, the annual number of nonimmigrant visas issued by the State Department decreased for the third time to 9 million—a 7 percent decline from the 9.7 million issued in FY 2017.The Trump administration implemented a number of policies in 2017 and 2018 that could lead to a decline in admissions, including the travel ban barring individuals from certain countries from U.S. entry, lengthened visa application processes, and greater discretion for consular officers to deny visas. From FY 2015 to FY 2018, visa refusal rates for tourists and business travelers from travel-ban countries increased significantly: all applications from North Korea were denied, followed by Somalia (90 percent), Iran (88 percent), Yemen (83 percent), Syria (77 percent), and Libya and Venezuela (74 percent each). Furthermore, during the same period, visa refusal rates rose for visitors from some major non-travel ban countries, including Mexico (from 20 percent to 25 percent), mainland China (from 10 percent to 17 percent), and India (from 24 percent to 26 percent).Three-quarters of the 9 million nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2018 were temporary business and tourist visas (B and BCC visas).The next largest visa class was for academic students and exchange visitors and their family members (F and J visa categories), who comprised around 8 percent of all nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2018. The third largest group of nonimmigrant visas was given to temporary workers and trainees and their family members (H visa categories), who comprised 7 percent of nonimmigrant visas.Looking at the distribution of temporary visas issued in 2018 by region of origin, the largest shares were issued to nationals from Asia (43 percent), North America (22 percent, including Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean), and South America (18 percent). The remainder: Europe (12 percent), Africa (6 percent), and Oceania (0.7 percent).Note: The number of visas issued does not necessarily match the number of foreign nationals who entered the United States in the same year because some nonimmigrant visas may not be used.How many nonimmigrant admissions does DHS grant in a year? In total, DHS granted 181 million nonimmigrant admissions in 2017, of which 103 million were admissions of Canadians traveling for business or pleasure and Mexicans who possess a nonresident Border Crossing Card (i.e., laser visa). These travelers are exempt from completing the I-94 arrival/departure form at the port of entry, thus DHS does not provide characteristics for this group.In 2017, there were 77.6 million total temporary admissions of I-94 nonimmigrants, a slight uptick from 77.1 million in 2016. (See Table 3.)Table 3. Nonimmigrant Admissions by Category, FY 2017Source: DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2017.Note: Nonimmigrant admissions represent the number of entries. Individuals may have multiple entries within the year. OIS reports characteristics of nonimmigrants who must complete an I-94 arrival/departure form at entry.Notes on Refugees and AsyleesWhat is the difference between a refugee and an asylee? In the United States, the main difference is the person's location at the time of application. 
Refugees are nearly always outside of the United States when they are considered for resettlement, whereas asylum seekers submit their applications while physically present in or at a port of entry to the United States. Asylum seekers can submit an asylum request either affirmatively or defensively.The affirmative asylum process applies to persons who initially file an asylum application with USCIS as well as applicants who subsequently have their application referred by USCIS to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The defensive asylum process applies to persons in removal proceedings who appear before EOIR and people who apply for asylum at U.S. borders and points of entry.How many refugees entered the United States, and where were they from?Every year, the president in consultation with Congress sets the annual refugee admissions ceiling and allocations by region of origin. For FY 2019, the annual ceiling was set at 30,000, the lowest since the program began in 1980.In FY 2018, 22,491 refugees were resettled in the United States, amounting to less than half of the admission ceiling of 45,000 allocated for that year—largely due to processing delays and policies put in place to increase vetting of refugees. This represents a 58 percent drop compared to the 53,716 admitted in 2017.The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Myanmar (also known as Burma), Ukraine, Bhutan, and Eritrea were the primary countries of nationality, accounting for 78 percent (17,565) of all refugees resettled in 2018. Rounding out the top ten were Afghanistan, El Salvador, Pakistan, Russia, and Ethiopia. Together, nationals of the top ten countries comprised 90 percent (20,349) of all refugee arrivals in 2018.Table 4. Top Ten Countries of Refugee Admissions by Nationality, FY 2018Source: MPI tabulation of Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS) data from the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.How many asylum applications were filed and where are asylum seekers from?In FY 2018, an estimated 106,147 affirmative asylum applications were received by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—25 percent fewer than the 141,695 in FY 2017. This is the first decline in application volume after eight years of growth. Applicants for affirmative asylum must be present in the United States, and do not include those seeking asylum through the defensive asylum process while in removal proceedings.Venezuela was the top country of origin for received affirmative asylum applications, with 28,485 in FY 2018; followed by Guatemala (10,177), El Salvador (9,157), China (8,114), and Mexico (6,636).Meanwhile, 111,887 defensive asylum applications were filed with the Department of Justice’s immigration court system, known as the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), in FY 2018—an 8 percent decrease from 121,418 applications filed a year earlier.What is the asylum approval rate?According to USCIS, in FY 2018, 30 percent of affirmative asylum adjudicated petitions were approved, a decline from the 43 percent in FY 2016 and 37 percent in FY 2017.The same downward trend also applies to asylum petitions adjudicated by immigration courts. In FY 2018, 33 percent of such petitions were approved, versus 43 percent in FY 2016 and 37 percent in FY 2017.How many people receive asylum status?According to the most recent data at the time of this writing, in FY 2016, 20,455 individuals, including principal applicants and their spouses and/or unmarried children under age 21, were granted asylum after seeking protection upon or after arrival in the United States—a 22 percent drop from 26,124 a year earlier. An additional 5,490 individuals outside the United States were approved for asylum as immediate family members of principal applicants. (Note that this number reflects travel documents issued to these family members, not their arrival in the United States.)The big drop in asylum grants and the follow-to-join cases are mainly due to the mounting backlog in the USCIS Asylum Division, as a growing number of USCIS asylum officers have been diverted from the affirmative interview process to conduct credible and reasonable fear screening interviews with adults and families apprehended or found inadmissible at the U.S. border who express an intention to seek asylum.China was the top country of origin for those receiving asylum, with 4,484 persons (or 22 percent of total asylum grants). The next four largest countries of origin were El Salvador (2,157), Guatemala (1,949), Honduras (1,505), and Mexico (919). Together, nationals of these five countries made up 32 percent of those receiving asylum in FY 2016.What is the current backlog for asylum applicants?Due to the large application volume and limited resources, both the affirmative and defensive asylum systems have extensive backlogs. At the end of January 2019, according to USCIS, there were 352,277 affirmative cases pending; EOIR reported 821,726 total immigration cases pending, of which MPI estimated roughly 30 percent were defensive asylum ones.How many unauthorized immigrants are in the United States?The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants resided in the United States in 2016. About half of all unauthorized immigrants resided in three states: California (27 percent), Texas (14 percent), and New York (8 percent). The vast majority (82 percent) lived in 174 counties with 10,000 or more unauthorized immigrants each, of which the top five—Los Angeles County, CA; Harris County, TX; Cook County, IL; Orange County, CA; and Queens County, NY—accounted for 20 percent of all unauthorized immigrants.Note: MPI is among a small number of organizations that generate estimates of the unauthorized population because the Census Bureau does not. It is important to acknowledge that the estimates issued by MPI and others (including the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Pew Research Center, and Center for Migration Studies of New York) are based on different methodologies and data sources. Hence the estimates are not fully comparable.Where are unauthorized immigrants from?Mexicans and Central Americans are estimated to account for roughly two-thirds (67 percent or 7.6 million) of the unauthorized immigrants in the United States as of 2012-16, MPI estimates. About 1.8 million (16 percent) were from Asia; 685,000 (6 percent) from South America; 579,000 (5 percent) from Europe, Canada, or Oceania; 351,000 (3 percent) from the Caribbean; and 318,000 (32 percent) from Africa.The top five countries of birth for unauthorized immigrants were Mexico (53 percent), El Salvador (6 percent), Guatemala (5 percent), and China and Honduras (3 percent each).How many unauthorized immigrants live with children under age 18?As of 2012-16, about 4 million unauthorized immigrants (37 percent of the overall unauthorized population ages 15 and older) lived with one or more children under age 18, MPI estimates. Of this group, about 82 percent (3.3 million) resided with at least one U.S.-citizen child under age 18, and 17 percent (697,000) lived with only non-U.S.-citizen children.How many children under age 18 live with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent?Approximately 5.1 million children under age 18 lived with an unauthorized immigrant parent during the 2012-16 period, representing 7 percent of the U.S. child population. About 80 percent (4.1 million) of these children were U.S. citizens, another 16 percent (809,000) were themselves unauthorized, and 3 percent (167,000) were legally present, including LPRs and those with temporary visas.How many people were eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and how many applications have been received since its launch in 2012? The DACA program, announced on June 15, 2012, offered a two-year grant of deportation relief and work authorization to eligible young unauthorized immigrants. Requirements for eligibility included:MPI estimates that as of 2018 approximately 1.3 million people met all criteria to apply under the original DACA program, 408,000 met all criteria except for education, and 120,000 would be eligible upon turning 15 provided they remain in school.However, on September 5, 2017, the Trump administration announced the rescission of DACA, with a six-month wind-down. This decision has been challenged in multiple federal courts and a nationwide injunction has kept the DACA program in place, but only for people who currently have or in the past have had DACA benefits.Between August 15, 2012, when USCIS began accepting applications, and September 30, 2018 (the most recent data available at the time of this writing), 908,755 initial applications were accepted for consideration. Thus, as of September 30, 2018, about 70 percent of the immediately eligible population had applied. USCIS approved 823,283 (or 91 percent) of these initial applications; 79,763 (9 percent) were denied, and the remainder were pending.The top states of residence for accepted initial applications since the program’s inception are California (27 percent), Texas (16 percent), New York (6 percent), and Illinois and Florida (5 percent each). The top countries of origin are Mexico (78 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and Peru and Brazil (1 percent each).On June 5, 2014, USCIS began accepting DACA renewal applications, and as of September 30, 2018 had accepted 1,352,730 such applications (with some DACA holders renewing for the second or third time). By the end of September 2018, 96 percent (1,297,626) of the renewal applications had been approved, with 3 percent (40,392) pending, and 1 percent (13,717) denied.How many unauthorized immigrants were active participants of the program?As of August 30, 2018, according to most recent data from USCIS, 699,350 individuals were current DACA recipients. MPI estimates that 54 percent of the immediately eligible population as of 2018 were participating the program.The top states of residence for DACA active participants were California (29 percent), Texas (16 percent), Illinois and New York (about 5 percent each), followed by Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina (about 4 percent each).The top countries of origin of active DACA program participants were Mexico (80 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and Peru and South Korea (1 percent each).How many people are covered by Temporary Protected Status?Since the enactment of the Immigration Act of 1990, the United States has occasionally granted a form of humanitarian relief called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) when the home countries of foreign nationals in the United States experience natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other circumstances making return unsafe. TPS offers work authorization and protection from deportation for six- to 18-month periods. The first country to be designated for TPS was El Salvador in 1990 to protect Salvadorans who had fled the country’s civil war. Since 1990, 22 countries have been designated for TPS. Ten countries currently are designated: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. TPS protects nearly 318,000 people from ten countries, with the largest groups being Salvadorans (195,000), Hondurans (57,000), and Haitians (46,000).The Trump administration has announced that it will not extend TPS for immigrants from Sudan, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, Nepal, and Honduras when those designations expire. As a result, 98 percent of grantees could lose permission to work and protection from deportation—with the Haitian designation originally set to end on July 22, 2019; the Salvadoran one on September 9, 2019; and for Honduras on January 5, 2020.However, there have been several legal challenges, including one (Ramos v. Nielsen) that resulted in a preliminary injunction barring termination of the Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador designations. The nationals of these four countries will receive automatic extension of TPS and work permits as long as the injunction remains in place.How many unaccompanied children and families have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border?Apprehensions at the Southwest border grew significantly in the first five months of FY 2019, due to the increase in families seeking asylum. Between October 2018 and February 2019, the most recent period for which data are available, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more than 136,000 minor children and adults travelling as family units and about 27,000 unaccompanied children along the Southwest border. This represents a significant uptick over the 107,200 family units and 50,000 unaccompanied children apprehended in all of FY 2018. These children and families are primarily from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.Note: The term “family unit” refers to individuals—either a child under 18 years old, parent, or legal guardian—apprehended with a family member by the U.S. Border Patrol.Note: The government fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. All figures for immigration control and enforcement given here are for the fiscal year. The data presented here are the most recent offered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).How many apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants occur at the border annually?CBP reported a total of 404,142 apprehensions at both southern and northern borders in 2018, a significant increase from 310,531 in 2017, and closer to the 415,816 apprehensions in 2016. Ninety-eight percent of Border Patrol apprehensions in 2018 occurred along the Southwest border. While apprehensions were up in 2018, they remained a small share of the 1.6 million that occurred during the peak year of 2000.Note: Apprehensions are events, not individuals. In other words, the same individual can be apprehended more than once, with each apprehension counted separately.How many people are arrested by ICE within the United States yearly?ICE made 158,581 administrative arrests in 2018, up 11 percent from a year earlier. An administrative arrest is the arrest of an individual for a civil violation of U.S. immigration law, which is subsequently adjudicated by an immigration judge or through other administrative processes.How many people are deported per year?Removals and returns result in the confirmed movement of inadmissible or deportable aliens out of the United States. Both ICE and CBP conduct removals and returns. There were 256,085 removals and returns carried out by ICE in 2018, an increase of 13 percent from 2017. Data do not appear to be publicly available on the number of removals and returns conducted by CBP for 2017 or 2018.How many immigrants are naturalized citizens?In 2017, 22 million immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, accounting for 49 percent of the total foreign-born population (44.5 million) and almost 7 percent of the U.S. population (325.7 million), according to ACS estimates.Of the 22 million naturalized citizens, 27 percent were naturalized between 2010 and 2017, 31 percent between 2000 and 2009, and 42 percent prior to 2000.How many immigrants become U.S. citizens annually?USCIS naturalized 707,000 LPRs in 2017. The total number of immigrants receiving U.S. citizenship decreased by 6 percent from 753,000 in 2016, even though the number of petitions filed increased from 972,000 in 2016 to 987,000 in 2017. The decrease in naturalizations granted is a combination of factors including longer processing time due to higher demand (8.1 months in 2017) and applications denials (83,000 in 2017).From a historical perspective, naturalizations have increased dramatically in recent decades. On average, fewer than 120,000 LPRs became citizens each year between 1950 and 1969, 210,000 in the 1980s, 500,000 in the 1990s, and 680,000 during the 2000s.Naturalizations reached an all-time high in 2008, increasing 59 percent from 660,000 in 2007 to 1,047,000 in 2008. This came as a result of impending application fee increases and the promotion of U.S. citizenship in advance of the 2008 presidential elections. Between 2010 and 2017, the average annual number of naturalizations was about 712,000.How many foreign nationals become U.S. citizens through military naturalization?In 2017, 6,900 foreign-born military personnel naturalized as U.S. citizens—a 23 percent drop from 2016 when 8,900 military personnel became Americans. Since 2002, 118,100 foreign-born military personnel naturalized on U.S. soil. Another 11,500 became citizens overseas or aboard Navy ships.Where are newly naturalized citizens from?Of those who naturalized in 2017, 17 percent were born in Mexico (119,000), roughly 7 percent in India (51,002), and 5 percent each in China (38,000) and the Philippines (37,000). Immigrants from these four countries, together with those from the Dominican Republic (30,000), Cuba (26,000), Vietnam (19,000), El Salvador (17,000), Colombia (16,000), and Jamaica (15,000), comprised the top ten countries of birth for newly naturalized citizens in 2017. These ten countries accounted for 52 percent of the 707,000 new U.S. citizens that fiscal year.Table 5. Top Ten Countries of Origin of Newly Naturalized Citizens, 2017Source: DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2017.Where do newly naturalized citizens live in the United States?In 2017, 57 percent of the newly naturalized lived in one of five states. California had the largest number of newly naturalized citizens, with 22 percent (157,000), followed by 12 percent in New York (86,000), 10 percent in Florida (70,000), 7 percent in Texas (51,000), and 6 percent in New Jersey (39,000).The top five metropolitan areas with the largest number of naturalizations were New York-Newark-Jersey City (113,000), Los Angeles-Long Beach (59,000), Miami-Ft Lauderdale-West Palm Beach (45,000), Washington-Arlington-Alexandria (30,000), and Chicago-Naperville (23,000). These five metropolitan areas accounted for over a third (38 percent) of all naturalizations in FY 2017.How many green-card holders are eligible to naturalize?According to the latest available DHS estimates, about 8.9 million of the 13.2 million green-card holders residing in the United States on January 1, 2014 were eligible to naturalize.How long does it take on average for green-card holders to naturalize?On average, immigrants held green cards for eight years before becoming U.S. citizens in 2017—an average year longer than green-card holders in 2016. The time varied by country of origin: African- and Asian-born immigrants spent an average six years in LPR status before naturalization, followed by those born in South America (eight years), Europe (nine years), Oceania (ten years), and North America (including Central America, eleven years).In general, naturalization requires being at least 18 years of age, passing English and civic exams, and for most, residing in the United States with LPR status continuously for at least five years (three years for those married to a U.S. citizen).How many visa applications for permanent immigration (green cards) are backlogged?Notes on Visa BacklogsTwo types of backlogs impact the issuance of green cards.The first is due to visa availability (with caps established in 1990):The second type of backlog is due to processing delays of applicants' documents, which is related to government processing capacity as well as increased background and criminal checks.In February 2019, the U.S. government was still processing some family-sponsored visa applications dating to August 1995, and employment-related visa applications from August 2007.According to data on the petitions submitted to the State Department, there were about 3.8 million applicants (including spouses and minor children) who were on the waiting list as of November 1, 2018, the first time the backlog dropped in recent years.The overwhelming majority of backlogs were family-sponsored applicants (3.7 million, which includes the principal applicant and their immediate family members). About 121,000 were employment-sponsored applicants and their families.Of the overall 3.8 million applicants, 1.2 million were citizens of Mexico, followed by those from the Philippines (314,000), India (299,000), Vietnam and China (with 232,000 each). Family- and employment-based prospective immigrants who are waiting to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident from within the United States are not included in the State Department estimate.USCIS also publishes backlog statistics but only for petitions approved in one of the five employment-based categories. USCIS data show that close to 395,000 approved employment-based immigrant petitions were awaiting a priority date based on the May 2018 Department of State Visa Bulletin. The figure corresponds to the number of primary applicants covered by these petitions but excludes their dependents. To MPI knowledge, USCIS did not publish backlog statistics on other types of green card applications the agency adjudicates.In other words, the overall number of people waiting for a green card—within and outside of the United States—is likely to be larger than the 3.8 million reported by the State Department (as of November 2018) and 395,000 reported by USCIS (as of May 2018).Additional Data Resources:Jie Zong is an Associate Policy Analyst providing quantitative research support across MPI programs.Jeanne Batalova is a Senior Policy Analyst at MPI and Manager of the Migration Data Hub.Micayla Burrows is an intern with MPI's National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy.Use our interactive maps, with the latest available data, to learn where immigrant populations, by country or region of birth, live in the United States—at state, county, and metro levels.

Under the Obama administration, ICE granted Berrones a stay of removal and allowed him to remain free with a work permit.“The mindset now is, 'Deport now, ask questions later,'” Wilkes said.MORE: Deported Arizona mom makes new life in Mexico but misses kids 'dearly'A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Berrones, a furniture upholsterer and air conditioning maintenance worker, lives in Phoenix and has been in the United States since he was about 18 months old, Wilkes told The Arizona Republic.Federal immigration authorities want to reinstate a deportation order despite the stress his deportation would put the man's young family, including a 5-year-old boy receiving intensive chemotherapy for a rare form of leukemia, Wilkes said.Berrones has five children, all U.S. citizens including two from a previous relationship and three with his wife, Sonia Garcia, 24. She is a U.S. citizen, and pregnant, Wilkes said.“This is not just a man who is a husband and a father, he is an example to these kids.”“It would be catastrophic in every literal and emotional sense of the word. This is not just a man who is a husband and a father, he is an example to these kids,” Wilkes said.Rather than report to ICE, the man on Friday sought sanctuary inside a north Phoenix church, Shadow Rock United Church of Christ.Sitting in the sanctuary of the church on Sunday, as his children played outside, Berrones said he doesn't want to be deported so that he can try and fix his immigration problems and continue to support his family.His son, Jayden, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2016, when he was hospitalized. After receiving more than a year of treatment. He still has two more years of treatment left, including taking chemotherapy pills several times a day, and monthly visits to Phoenix Children's Hospital.MORE: DOJ threatens 'sanctuary cities' with subpoenas, escalating enforcementHis wife cannot give him the pills because handling or being near the drugs could pose a danger to her pregnancy, he said.Sonia Garcia and Jesus Berrones sit with Berrones' 5-year-old son Jayden at Shadow Rock Shadow Rock United Church of Christ where Jesus is in sanctuary on Feb. 11, 2018 in Phoenix. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)He said he was brought to the U.S. illegally when he was a year and five months old, and was never able to legalize his status.He attended school in Phoenix since he was in kindergarten, including Camelback High School and Summit High School.He said the only close relative he has in Mexico is his father, who he does not know."I just don't want to be deported and lose my family," he said.The Shadow Rock congregation offered to allow the dad to live inside the church to protect him from being arrested and deported until he can exhaust his legal options to stay in the U.S., said Rev. Ken Heintzleman, the pastor.MORE: Each day, 120 'dreamers' lose protection from deportation"Our society really looks down on fathers who are neglectful," Heintzleman said. "This man crossed the desert I think twice, put his life at risk in order to be a father and to take care of his family. He should really be praised and commended rather than judged, and punished and deported."In addition to Berrones, six immigrants facing deportation have lived at the same church since 2014, including one other immigrant from Mexico still there, Heintzleman said."Our mission has been from the beginning, it's very simple, it's to keep families together and to keep people safe," he said.ICE officials could not be immediately reached for comment.Wilkes said Berrones was caught driving with a fake driver's license in 2006 following a traffic stop when he was a minor. He pleaded guilty to a felony charge of solicitation of forgery, which resulted in him being voluntary returned to Mexico when he was 17 or 18. He returned illegally to the U.S. two weeks later, but was voluntary removed again in 2010, Wilkes said, but again returned illegally.“He has a U.S. citizen family member who will suffer extremely without him, he can show good morale character, and in addition, he is married to a U.S. citizen.”In 2016, Berrones was caught by ICE again. He was facing a felony illegal re-entry charge, but instead was charged with a misdemeanor unlawful entry charge."It took it down from a felony to a misdemeanor," Berrones said. Wilkes also was able to get Berrones's 2016 felony conviction set aside, which made it possible for him to ask ICE for a 1-year stay or removal, which was granted based on humanitarian factors because of his sick son, he said.ICE then released Berrones from custody,  and was allowed to apply for a work permit.In June, 2017, however, Berrones received a phone call from ICE asking him to come in for a check-in, which he did, Wilkes said. During the check-in, ICE officials informed Berrones that he would be required to check-in every six months, Wilkes said.During his next check-in on Dec. 29, ICE officials informed Berrones that he would be deported in 30 days, which came as a shock, Wilkes said.Jesus Berrones poses for a picture at Shadow Rock Shadow Rock United Church of Christ on Feb. 11, 2018 in Phoenix. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)Wilkes said he asked ICE for another stay of removal, but ICE denied the stay on Feb. 8 without explanation, and told Berrones to show up at ICE's offices on Monday to be deported to Mexico.Berrones continues to wear the monitoring bracelet ICE placed on his ankle in December, Wilkes said.Wilkes said he is hoping ICE will reconsider granting Berrones a stay of removal. That would allow Berrones to seek to have his deportation order canceled, which would open the door for him to remain in legally in the U.S. with his family."He has a U.S. citizen family member who will suffer extremely without him, he can show good morale character, and in addition, he is married to a U.S. citizen," Wilkes said.READ MORE:Steve Montenegro's path to the U.S. shapes his tough views on immigrationDeported Arizona mom makes new life in Mexico but misses kids 'dearly'The latest on DACA: What you need to know for the upcoming Congress debateState of the Union: Trump pitches immigration plan as 'fair compromise'Want more news like this? Subscribe to azcentral.com. Promoting the further fragmenting of the country, Rubio suggested the best way to spread liberty was to bring predominantly poor migrants into the country and then speak to them in their native language (even though one is technically supposed to learn English to become a voting citizen).“I do give interviews in Spanish,” Rubio said, “and here’s why– because I believe that free enterprise and limited government is the best way to help people who are trying to achieve upward mobility, and if they get their news in Spanish, I want them to hear that directly from me. Not from a translator at Univision.”As Rubio continues to struggle in the polls— despite effectively unlimited financial resources and near-universal support from donor class conservatives— it was essential that he deliver a stellar performance in tonight’s second GOP debate.Instead he has opened an uncomfortable line of inquiry by highlighting his penchant for campaigning in a foreign language. Rubio has a long track record of delivering one message to English audiences and another to Spanish audience, even though he is given a free pass from career conservatives for doing so.For instance, during the height of debate about the Gang of Eight immigration bill in an interview with Univision, Rubio told his Spanish audience that amnesty and legalization of illegal immigrants would precede border enforcement. Rubio repeated this same tactic earlier this year when he endorsed Obama’s executive amnesty for illegal immigrants in a Spanish media interview with Jorge Ramos.Conservative icon and grassroots leader Phyllis Schlafly has argued that Rubio’s decision to campaign in Spanish while running to be the president of the United States ought to be inherently disqualifying: “Rubio’s [pro-executive amnesty] statement was made in Spanish on the Spanish-language network Univision, which is reason enough to eliminate him from serious consideration,” Schlafly said. “When somebody is running for President of the United States, why should we have to get somebody to translate his remarks into English?”After Ted Cruz mentioned that he had worked side-by-side with Senator Jeff Sessions to oppose the Gang of Eight bill Rubio championed, Rubio had no answer. He offered no defense whatsoever for his co-authorship of the immigration expansion bill endorsed by La Raza, Barack Obama, and the Silicon Valley billionaires. Instead, Rubio talked about securing the border and outlined several enforcement measures he thought needed to be enacted in order to successfully achieve border security.Borrowing a line from the GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, Rubio said the United States needs to build “a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system… and then they overstay the visa. We also need a mandatory e-verify system.”However, Rubio did not mention—nor did any of the moderators ask him why— he voted against all three of those enforcement measures in his attempt to pass his and Obama’s immigration expansion bill.Rubio’s immigration bill would have imported 33 million more immigrants into the country within the span of a single decade. In his answer, Rubio went on to indicate that— due to his failure to drag that bill across the finish line— if given a second chance, he’d chop it up into a small pieces but implement the same mass immigration. “We cannot deal with [these] problems in one massive piece of legislation,” Rubio said. This was the same strategy pushed by Eric Cantor before his historic electoral defeat.Polling shows that importing more immigrants would erode the Republican Party and nullify the electoral power of Republican voters watching the debate at home. Despite the resounding opposition of the Republican voters to the Rubio-Schumer immigration plan, Rubio introduced a new bill earlier this year that would similarly expand immigration and allow corporations to flood the labor market with cheap labor. Rubio’s I-Squared bill would triple the number of wage-depressing H-1B workers admitted into the country.In Rubio’s home state of Florida, corporations like Disney have used H-1B visas to axe American workers and replace them with untrained, lower-wage foreign laborers. The I-Squared bill is central to Rubio’s campaign platform of creating “A New American Economy” with fewer workers of Western descent — the implicit suggestion being that America’s economy will be more efficient and globally integrated if America’s population more closely resembled that of the global population. This bill has been endorsed and lobbied for by Disney’s CEO Bob Iger, Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who is one of Marco Rubio’s top donors.Conservative columnist Ann Coulter has been a critic of Rubio and other Republicans looking to surrender on the issue of illegal immigration. “Trump is leading on the seminal issue of our time [immigration] while the rest of the field practices looking optimistic in front of the mirror,” Coulter wrote in a recent column.Indeed, Donald Trump continued to connect with voters on his message of deporting illegal aliens and putting an end to a misinterpretation of the 14th amendment that allows the children of illegal immigrant parents to win U.S. citizenship. At the time of publication, Trump had received over 60% of the vote in Time‘s post-debate poll and 55% in the Drudge Report poll.Yet, perhaps in a sign of how far removed the people who make a comfortable living as professional Republicans are from the party’s voter base, as soon as Rubio began speaking, the praise began pouring out in unimaginably effusive terms.“Rubio is just hitting home runs all night,” tweeted RedState’s Erick Erickson“Rubio stomps on Trump,” Weekly Standard’s John McCormack wrote.“Rubio was excellent,” wrote National Review’s Rich Lowry. “Everything he said was well-received.” Lowry had been one of the fiercest opponents of Marco Rubio’s 2013 immigration expansion plan.In a surprising admission, National Review’s Charles Cooke told readers that he finds the thought of a Trump presidency more disturbing than the definitive end of limited government conservatism and the disenfranchisement of millions of conservative Americans, whose votes will be drowned out by an influx of migrants who favor big government policies.“Do you know what’s worse than the possibility that demographic change will shift the American psyche over time?” Cooke writes. “Hillary Clinton in office in 2017; Joe Biden in office in 2017; Donald Trump in office in 2017.”This sentiment is not at all in line with a Republican voter base responsible for propelling Trump in the polls. Those voters– along with the vast majority of Americans— are concerned about the economic and cultural impact our four-decades-long green card gusher has had on the nation. As Pat Buchanan recently explained, for the working men and women of this country, immigration “is the issue of the 21st century.”Buchanan writes:“Will the West endure, or disappear by the century’s end as another lost civilization? Mass immigration, if it continues, will be more decisive in deciding the fate of the West than Islamist terrorism… The character of [Western] countries will be altered forever, and smaller countries will become unrecognizable.”As the 2016 race continues to unfold, it will be interesting to see if career conservatives challenge Marco Rubio on his plan to bring about this “New American Century” with an immigration agenda that– as Phyllis Schlafly has said— will amount to “suicide for [the] Republican Party.”

White House
                        Senior White House aides met Sunday afternoon to discuss how to roll out the controversial move affecting hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.

Senior White House aides huddled Sunday afternoon to discuss the rollout of a decision likely to ignite a political firestorm — and fulfill one of the president’s core campaign promises.The administration’s deliberations on the issue have been fluid and fast moving, and the president has faced strong warnings from members of his own party not to scrap the program. Story Continued BelowTrump has wrestled for months with whether to do away with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA. But conversations with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who argued that Congress — rather than the executive branch — is responsible for writing immigration law, helped persuade the president to terminate the program and kick the issue to Congress, the two sources said. In a nod to reservations held by many lawmakers, the White House plans to delay the enforcement of the president’s decision for six months, giving Congress a window to act, according to one White House official. But a senior White House aide said that chief of staff John Kelly, who has been running the West Wing policy process on the issue, “thinks Congress should’ve gotten its act together a lot longer ago.”

                    By MICHAEL GRUNWALDWhite House aides caution that — as with everything in the Trump White House — nothing is set in stone until an official announcement has been made. Trump is expected to formally make that announcement on Tuesday, and the White House informed House Speaker Paul Ryan of the president’s decision on Sunday morning, according to a source close to the administration. Ryan had said during a radio interview on Friday that he didn’t think the president should terminate DACA, and that Congress should act on the issue.  A spokesman for Ryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement, “A decision is not finalized. We will make an announcement on Tuesday.”The president’s expected decision is likely to shore up his base, which rallied behind his broader campaign message about the importance of enforcing the country’s immigration laws and securing the border. At the same time, the president’s decision is likely to be one of the most contentious of his early administration, opposed by leaders of both parties and by the political establishment more broadly.Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politicsBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The White House and Congress have tried to pass the issue off on each other – with each arguing that the other is responsible for determining the fate of the approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants who are benefiting from DACA. Though most Republicans believe that rolling back DACA is a solid legal decision, they are conscious of the difficult emotional terrain. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch joined Ryan in cautioning Trump against rolling back the program.The president is likely to couch his decision in legalese. Many on the right, even those who support protections for children brought into the country illegally through no fault of their own, argue that DACA is unconstitutional because former President Barack Obama carried it out unilaterally instead of working through Congress. Some Republican lawmakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, have said that Congress needs to pass a law to protect the so-called Dreamers. “My hope is that as part of this process we can work on a way to deal with this issue and solve it through legislation, which is the right way to do it and the constitutional way to do it,” Rubio told CNN in June.

                    By MATTHEW NUSSBAUMTrump’s expected decision to scrap DACA within six months represents another challenge for Ryan and fellow congressional Republicans, who are facing an end-of-September deadline to avert a government shutdown and government debt default, while also tackling a Hurricane Harvey relief package and a major tax reform push.It’s not clear that Congress will be able to come to an agreement on the future of DACA.Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who previously said he was very disappointed by Trump’s lack of action on DACA, expressed fresh frustration on Sunday night with the idea of a delayed implementation.“Ending DACA now gives chance 2 restore Rule of Law. Delaying so R Leadership can push Amnesty is Republican suicide,” King tweeted.Meanwhile, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who has called on Trump to stand up for the Dreamers, tweeted out her displeasure with Trump’s expected announcement.“After teasing #Dreamers for months with talk of his 'great heart,' @POTUS slams door on them. Some 'heart'...” she wrote.Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.

                                            By Rich Lowry © 2019 POLITICO LLCAt the heart of the on-again, off-again immigration debate in Congress — a debate which, depending on who you ask, is either urgent or could stretch for several more months — is a time bomb that Donald Trump set for immigrants back in September, when he announced the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program..DACA protected hundreds of thousands of young adult unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allowed them to work legally since 2012. The immigrants protected through DACA grew up in the US; people might not assume they are unauthorized immigrants, and they might not have even known it themselves until they were teenagers. The program was supposed to give them a chance to build a life here.On September 5, the Trump administration declared that no one new would be protected under the program — and that those currently covered would start to lose their protection and work permits on March 6, 2018.At the time, Trump said that gave Congress 6 months to solve the problem. But in the months since, that situation has gotten more complicated. With March 6 quickly approaching, and little apparent urgency from Congress to act before then, tens of thousands of immigrants have already lost protection — but a court order from a federal judge allows them, as well as immigrants facing the loss of their protections and work permits in the near future, to apply for 2-year renewals. Trump won’t, and can’t, reactivate DACA or extend it. The program’s fate is in the hands of the courts; the fate of the immigrants it’s protected, meanwhile, is in the hands of Congress. The saga of DACA’s end has plunged a generation of immigrants who had known only uncertainty before DACA back into the anxiety they’d hoped to escape.Here’s a guide to the program, the people it protects, and what could happen in the near future.

  In the 1990s to mid-2000s, the US started building up enforcement on the US/Mexico border, with a huge unintended consequence: Many unauthorized immigrants avoided repeated risky border crossings by settling in the US with their families. (Previously, unauthorized immigrants had mostly been working-age men who crossed back and forth to the US for work while their families stayed in their home countries.)Around the same time, changes to US law made it nearly impossible for an immigrant to get legal status if they’d lived in the country illegally. So the children who crossed illegally into the US with their parents were growing up in a country where they could never become legal residents or citizens.These children became known as DREAMers, after the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation meant to give them a path to citizenship first introduced in 2001. But with that legislation stalled in Congress, President Barack Obama in 2012 created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. While it didn’t give them a path to citizenship, DACA offered DREAMers a temporary grant of protection from deportation and a permit to work legally in the US. The protections last two years, after which immigrants can apply to renew for them.Not all DREAMers, though, became DACA recipients. To apply for DACA, immigrants have to have come to the US before 2007, and have been 15 or younger when they arrived and younger than 31 when DACA was created in June 2012. They had to have a nearly spotless criminal record and be enrolled in high school or have a high school diploma or equivalent. Perhaps most importantly, they have to apply. It’s estimated that about 1.3 million people would be eligible for DACA, but as of September 5, when Trump ended the program, only about 690,000 had current protections.Not all DREAMers are from Mexico or Central America, and plenty of them came in other ways: their parents had legal work visas but the children did not, or their legal visas expired, or they tried to seek asylum and failed. What unites DREAMers, more than how they came to the US, is the experience they’ve had here. Technically, immigrants are eligible for DACA if they came to the US under the age of 16. But in practice, the majority were much younger when they immigrated. In the most recent survey of 3,063 DACA recipients, conducted in August 2017 by Tom Wong of UC San Diego (for the liberal think tank the Center for American Progress and other immigrant advocacy groups), the average age that respondents said they’d arrived in the US was 6-and-a-half years old.When defenders of DACA say that the immigrants who benefit from it are “American in all but paperwork,” or that the US is “the only country they remember,” this is what they’re talking about. Demographers call them the “1.5 generation”: unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children are technically first-generation residents of the US, because they were born in another country. But their life experiences have more in common with the US-born children of immigrants (known as the second generation). Many DREAMers say they didn’t even know they were unauthorized immigrants until they were teenagers — often when they discovered they couldn’t join their peers in getting a driver’s license or filling out financial aid forms for college, because they didn’t have Social Security numbers.That’s given rise to the talking point, often used by politicians, that DREAMers “were brought to the United States through no fault of their own,” or that they “are being punished for the sins of their parents.” Those talking points seek to draw a line: Adults who deliberately chose to come to (or stay in) the US without legal status should take responsibility for their actions, but children shouldn’t be blamed for being brought along. But from the perspective of DREAMers themselves, their parents came to the US to give their children a better life, just as any other immigrant parent does — and they resist efforts to make themselves look better by making their parents look like the real villains.The political debate over what to do about young unauthorized immigrants is, at this point, old enough that it could apply for DACA itself. The first proposal to allow people who’d come to the US as children to apply for legal immigrant status and eventually become citizens, was introduced in 2001 by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA). It was called the DREAM Act — Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors— a name that versions of the bill have kept ever since.For a while, the DREAM Act was seen as a moderate alternative to legalizing all 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the US. But with both Democrats and Republicans divided on immigration during the George W. Bush era — and with Republicans moving to the right on immigration under Barack Obama — it was never quite popular enough to get the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster in the Senate. In the most recent attempt, in December 2010, the bill passed the House and got a majority of votes in the Senate, but failed to clear 60.By that time, the risk that a DREAMer would get deported was much higher than it was in 2001, as the federal government had ramped up deportations to 400,000 a year. Because DREAMers were politically sympathetic — majorities of Americans wanted them to stay in the US — and well-integrated into their communities, they were sometimes able to raise public alarm when they were slotted for deportation — sometimes getting the federal government to back down.But sticking around and hoping not to get deported wasn’t a real solution. One of the reasons that legalizing or protecting DREAMers has been politically popular — even when legalizing other unauthorized immigrants, including their parents, has not — is the stereotype of DREAMers as high school valedictorians and high-achieving college students. This stereotype has been pushed by politicians on both sides of the aisle since the early days of the DREAM Act, and it’s the angle that much of the media coverage took in calling attention to the problem throughout the 2000s.There certainly are high-achieving DREAMers. But as a whole, they’re more diverse and less exceptional than the stereotype suggests — and the cliché of the DREAMer valedictorian can obscure just how much harder it is to succeed without legal status in the US. According to 2014 estimates from the Migration Policy Institute, nearly 400,000 young immigrants who would otherwise qualify for DACA don’t meet the educational requirements for it: They dropped out of high school and don’t have a GED. Even immigrants who are DACA-eligible often don’t go beyond high school; only 57,000 of them, or about 5 percent, have bachelor’s degrees, with another 20 percent currently enrolled in college. Given that unauthorized immigrants are likely to grow up in lower-income households and can’t get federal financial aid, including federal student loans, this isn’t necessarily surprising. But it’s also true that some immigrants have been dissuaded from pursuing their educational and career goals by their unauthorized status. Sociologist Roberto Gonzales of Harvard calls this the “transition to illegality”: Once teenagers find out the truth about being unauthorized, they have to adjust their expectations of what they can achieve in life to match their new reality. Many respond by losing motivation to succeed in school or pursue high-status careers, because they can’t imagine how it would be possible for an “illegal immigrant” to succeed.The “transition to illegality” usually doesn’t lead to people trying to leave the US — it just leads to them seeing their own lives as more like their parents’. They’re fluent in English, and are often close to American citizens: According to Wong’s survey, 25 percent of DACA recipients have at least one US-born child; 73 percent have at least one US citizen as a member of their immediate family (child, spouse or sibling). They’re still integrated into America. They just haven’t seen themselves as Americans.After the 2010 failure of the DREAM Act, President Obama claimed that the immigrants who would be eligible for legalization under it weren’t being deported anyway, since his administration was targeting “high-priority” immigrants (like those with criminal records) rather than “low-priority” immigrants who’d lived quietly in the US for years. But federal immigration agents were still deporting “low-priority” immigrants, including DREAMers. So in summer 2012, rather than relying on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to protect immigrants by declining to deport them, the administration decided to allow DREAMers to apply for protection from deportation themselves.In June 2012, President Obama announced the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It allowed young unauthorized immigrants who meet certain criteria to apply for a commitment from the federal government for "deferred action" — that is, a commitment not to initiate deportation proceedings — for two years. Successful applicants also received a work permit.DACA wasn’t a legalization program — technically speaking, immigrants who are “DACAmented” are lawfully present in the US, but don’t have legal status. It’s an important policy distinction. Having DACA doesn’t give immigrants any path to becoming legal permanent residents or citizens. Still, being lawfully present means that they’re able to get driver’s licenses even in states that don’t usually allow unauthorized immigrants to drive legally.But it’s also a reflection of the line between the powers the executive branch has on immigration and the powers reserved for Congress. The executive branch can’t legalize anybody. But it’s fairly common for presidents to allow certain groups of immigrants to apply for temporary relief and grant those requests on a case-by-case basis. (In 2005, for example, the George W. Bush administration allowed foreign students affected by Hurricane Katrina to apply for deferred action; in 2009, the Obama administration granted deferred action to widows and widowers of US citizens and their children.)When DACA was created, Democrats still hoped that Congress would pass a broad immigration reform bill in the near future. And in 2013, the Senate passed just such a bill. But the House never acted, and in the years since then, the common ground between Democrats and Republicans has gotten ever smaller. So DACA went from a short-term placeholder until a more permanent agreement can be made to the only hope, for now, for the 690,000 people who have it.All available research suggests that immigrants who’ve received DACA protections have been able to go further, educationally and economically, than other unauthorized immigrants — or than they would have without DACA.Wong’s August 2017 survey found that annual earnings had increased 80 percent under DACA — from an average of $20,000 to an average of $36,000. (This includes immigrants who are working part time, or who are working while enrolled in school, as well as those with full-time jobs.) Sixty-five percent had bought their first car; 16 percent had become homeowners. Five percent of DACA recipients had started their own businesses. Sixty percent of DACA recipients above the age of 25 — in other words, those most likely to have been in the workforce before DACA was rolled out in 2012 — said that with DACA they’d been able to find jobs that better suited the education and training they already had; 61 percent said they’d been able to find jobs that suited the careers they wanted to have. DACA recipients were already primed to do better than many unauthorized immigrants because of their fluency in English and education in the US: in 2014, a Migration Policy Institute analysis found that the population eligible for DACA (including both those who had applied and those who hadn’t) was less likely to be in professional or managerial jobs than US citizens, but much more likely to be working white-collar jobs than other unauthorized immigrants. But having DACA allowed immigrants to capitalize on those gains in an important way. A 2014 study conducted by the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at UCLA found that 84 percent of immigrants with DACA were employed compared to 68 percent of their unauthorized peers, and that DACA recipients earned 20 percent more than similar immigrants without DACA.There might be more to the benefits of DACA than simply the fact that recipients can work legally. If the “transition to illegality” forced many immigrants to narrow their ambitions, there’s evidence DACA has opened them back up. Its respondents aren’t just finding jobs, but careers: in a 2015 survey, 80 percent of respondents agreed that they feel more likely to achieve their career goals now that they have DACA. They’re buying homes in the US with the intent to stay.

  In a survey conducted a year after DACA, in 2013, most DACA recipients felt safer after getting protected from deportation: 66 percent said they were no longer afraid, and 64 percent said they felt more like they belonged in the US. As the program continued, those feelings only grew. In 2015, 78 percent of DACA recipients said they were no longer afraid. And 72 percent said they felt like they belonged in America.That feeling of security allowed them to plan their futures. It freed them from some of the mental health damage that constant deportation stress can cause. And it allowed them to go from being unable to imagine themselves anywhere but America to seeing themselves as Americans.When the Trump administration said it was ending DACA “on March 5,” what it really meant was that no immigrant whose current work permit expired on March 5 or later would have the opportunity to reapply. But immigrants whose work permits were set to expire between September 5 and March 5 were given only a month to reapply — and 22,000 of them missed that deadline.Many of the immigrants who missed the reapplication deadline had submitted their applications on time, but, as Vox reported, were subjected to mysterious weeks-long mail delays and to the government’s refusal to accept some applications that were in its mailboxes at the deadline. The government announced that it would allow them to reapply, but at least one former DACA recipient was arrested and detained by ICE, and put in deportation proceedings, while waiting to be invited to resubmit his application.An estimate from the progressive Center for American Progress determined that an average of 122 immigrants have lost DACA each day from September 5 to March 5. And after March 5 — when immigrants who didn’t even have the chance to renew in the fall will start losing their work permits — that trickle becomes a stream of 1000 immigrants per day or more.In January, a federal judge in California issued a shocking ruling ordering the Trump administration to partially revive DACA while a lawsuit against the administration’s attempt to end it worked through the courts. Surprisingly, instead of dragging its feet, the Trump administration quickly announced that it would accept applications again from 3 groups of DACA recipients:And while no immigrant is allowed to apply for DACA who’s never had it before (for example, people who were too young to apply for DACA before September 5, 2017, but have turned 16 since then), immigrants who once had DACA but whose work permits expired more than a year ago are allowed to reapply for an “initial” DACA grant.This officially renders the March 5 “deadline” useless — after all, right now, both immigrants with work permits expiring on March 4 and those with permits expiring on March 6 (or May 6) can apply for renewals. But none of those renewals have actually been approved yet, and it’s not clear how long US Citizenship and Immigration Services will take to process them.The Trump administration is trying to get the Supreme Court to review the judge’s order directly — skipping the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Even if the Supreme Court agrees, it probably won’t issue its own ruling for several months. But it’s generally assumed that the Supreme Court will side with the Trump administration and allow the government to shut down DACA renewals again. It’s just a question of when that will happen and how many DACA recipients will have gotten extensions in the meantime.In theory, Trump administration officials claim they’re targeting immigrants with criminal records for deportation — and that they won’t target DREAMers even after they’ve lost DACA protections. In practice, it appears deportation efforts are going after the lowest-hanging fruit — the immigrants they can most easily track down and pick up.  That can put former DACA-holders at substantial risk.There are too many DACA recipients for the administration to arrest all of them, much less deport them — and because DACA recipients haven’t been previously deported or ordered deported, it wouldn’t be possible to without putting them through a yearslong immigration court process. But the risk of deportation could be, if anything, higher after DACA than it was beforehand. In the meantime, immigrants stripped of DACA protections could attempt to continue to live the lives they’d been living with DACA: working, driving around, being “undocumented and unafraid.” If they did that, they’d put themselves in legal jeopardy multiple times a day, and increase the risk of their deportation.They could try to prepare to leave the country: selling the car or house they purchased while protected by DACA, trying to find a country that would welcome the skills they’d no longer have the opportunity to use in the US. But for a cohort of people who grew up in the US, and who have spent the last half-decade living here with some legitimacy, that wouldn’t be an easy step to take — if it were, more of them would have taken it rather than live under the uncertainty of DACA to begin with.Or they could try to return to the shadows — taking the sort of jobs they had before DACA. They could try to transition back to illegality. In the meantime, they’ve had to make the same decisions that any other person in their late teens, 20s, or early 30s has to make from November of one year to August of another: whether to change jobs or even careers, whether they should go back to school or take a break from school to work, whether to move to a new town or stay at home to save money and help family.They’ve done all this with the knowledge that they could be making plans for a future that could evaporate with the stroke of a pen. And over the last several months, each new development has made their situation even more precarious and harder to predict.For DACA recipients themselves, the endgame now is the same as it was in September — or even in 2011. Either Congress will provide them with an opportunity to apply for full legal status, or it won’t. If it doesn’t, their days of feeling at least a little more American are numbered — and they know exactly how many days they have left.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content and targeted ads, analyze site traffic, and understand where our audience is coming from.

The program is now set to end on March 5, six months after US Attorney Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration planned to phase out DACA, which has protected as many as 800,000 undocumented people.The failure to protect these people would be a tragedy, because the program has changed many, many lives for the better, as my research and that of others has shown. It took them out of limbo and let them contribute to their families, communities, and the US economy.When the Obama administration launched DACA in 2012, it amounted to a natural experiment: What would happen if you gave a portion of the overall population of undocumented immigrants fresh access to employment and other opportunities?Immigrants who applied for protection under the program — enrollment is not automatic — were at least temporarily shielded from deportation. They also got temporary Social Security numbers and two-year work permits. To qualify, they had to have arrived in the US before 2007 (at 15 years old, or younger), been 30 or younger in 2012, and either have a high-school degree or be enrolled in high school or similar educational program.When the program began, I started a national research project to study the effects on its beneficiaries. Those effects were profound: Under DACA, beneficiaries saw increased educational attainment, higher social mobility, and better mental health.My research into undocumented immigrants predates DACA. From 2002 to 2015, I followed 150 undocumented young adults in Los Angeles, examining how they transitioned to adulthood in a context of limited rights. In Lives in Limbo: Undocumented and Coming of Age in America, I compared a group of people who attended college with a group that had left school at or before high school graduation.Pre-DACA, even those young adults who had attained advanced degrees found their work and life outcomes limited — and unusually similar to those of less-educated peers. Lacking Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, and other credentials, college graduates found they had little choice but to enter the informal, low-wage labor market.In 2011, I sat across an auto assembly plant lunchroom table from Jonathan, who had not graduated from high school, and Ricardo, who had two postsecondary degrees. If Ricardo had been a citizen, he would have had his choice of attractive job possibilities, but both, now in their late twenties, faced the same limited work options.Many people I interviewed described chronic headaches, toothaches, ulcers, difficulty sleeping problems, eating disorders, and thoughts of suicide. They had grown up in communities around Los Angeles and (as a result of the 1982 Supreme Court decision Plyler v. Doe, which opened the door to a K-12 education) they had attended school alongside American-born and citizen peers.But at a critical stage in their lives, their immigration status blocked important rites of passage — they couldn’t get getting driver’s licenses, after-school jobs, or financial aid for college. (Many colleges would allow them to enroll, but they were disqualified from federal financial aid.)Life in the shadows enacts a heavy toll. In my book, using a term from sociology, I argued that illegality was a “master status”: a binding constraint that overwhelmed all other traits and achievements. It acted as a lead weight that eventually dragged them down.The undocumented young adults in my study were the embodiment of Langston Hughes’s “dream deferred.”But with DACA, things changed for many of these same people. In 2013, my research team surveyed nearly 2,700 DACA-eligible young adults. Moreover, beginning in 2015, we carried out two waves of in-depth, in-person interviews with 481 DACA beneficiaries in six states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, New York, and South Carolina.Just 16 months into the program, 59 percent of respondents reported having found a new job. Over one-fifth of the people we surveyed had obtained a paid internship.Undocumented immigrants aren’t forbidden from having credit cards or bank accounts, but having a Social Security number makes getting these financial tools a lot easier. Almost one-half of our survey respondents opened up their first bank account after receiving DACA, and a third acquired their first credit card. Close to 60 percent of our respondents had obtained a driver’s license.Twenty-one percent of those we surveyed reported that their access to health care had improved, sometimes because they had access to health plans provided by schools or employers.DACA’s benefits appear to be greatest for people with degrees from four-year colleges. They were more than 1.5 times as likely to obtain new jobs and increase their earnings than DACA beneficiaries who never went to college. It seems they were finally able to make full use of their credentials and networks.Our findings are now a couple of years old, but they have been corroborated. Six months ago, the political scientist Tom K. Wong, of UC San Diego, released results from a similar survey of DACA beneficiaries that found that 69 percent of respondents reported moving to a job with better pay. More than half moved to a job that they thought better fit their education and training, or offered better working conditions.Much of the political and media coverage of this group has focused on the academically gifted, but, in terms of distance traveled, DACA’s biggest success stories involve moderate achievers. Most undocumented immigrant youth end their schooling before entering college. (In fact, more than 40 percent fail to complete high school.)Many of our respondents reported that DACA led them enroll in community college or in jobs-training programs sponsored by community-based organizations. DACA beneficiaries who completed certificate or licensing programs — in fields like nursing, dentistry, construction, and cosmetology — experienced significant growth in salary. Sixty-eight percent who did so told us their hourly salaries increased from the $5-to-$8 range to more than $14 an hour.Less tangible, but equally important, is DACA’s positive role in improving the mental health and general well-being of its beneficiaries. More than two-thirds of recipients told us they were less afraid of law enforcement and of being deported. (Fifty-nine percent of our respondents say they would report a crime now in a situation when they wouldn’t before.)Being able to get a driver’s license or to obtain lawful employment is about more than transportation and work: It’s about not having to always look over your shoulder. Nearly 70 percent indicated that they feel less stress in general.Eighteen-year-old Carolina, who is from Illinois, told us, “My freshman and sophomore year, I did really bad [in school], mostly because I was just not motivated because … all of this is going to be worthless in the end.” With DACA, her mindset changed: “OK, I actually have a chance,” she said.Failing to replace DACA would also have negative consequences for the schools, hospitals, tech firms, courts, and community organizations for which this population is now able to work. There are now thousands of “DACAmented” teachers in US schools.While not a perfect policy — only a pathway to citizenship would offer that — DACA has provided a significant boost to a large number of young people. The research is clear that DACA beneficiaries have made truly impressive economic and educational gains.Our elected officials still have a chance to correct the mistake of ending this important program. Failing to do so would hurt the lives of thousands of people in cruel fashion and to no purpose. It would be a stain on the soul of our nation.Roberto G.

  Last week, President Obama issued new guidelines allowing immigrants who illegally entered the United States as children to remain here so long as they are under the age of 30, have not been convicted of any crimes, and have either graduated from a US high school, are currently enrolled in school, or have served in the military. Obama lacks the legal authority to legalize their presence in the US; but he has in effect assured these people that they will not be prosecuted or deported for so long as his new policy remains in place.This reform strikes me as a major step in the right direction. It allows some 800,000 people to live their lives in peace without the fear of being deported to a life of poverty and oppression in the Third World. It strikes a blow against the grave injustice of current immigration restrictions. All the standard objections to illegal immigration don’t apply here. For example, critics cannot argue that we are letting guilty people off the hook here, since these individuals came to the US as children and were not legally responsible for their actions at the time. Similarly, it is unlikely that these people will become burdens on the welfare state, given their educational credentials. In any event, increased immigration tends to reduce political support for welfare spending rather than raise it.I do disagree with claims that this decision by Obama is especially bold or politically brave. Polls show that 84% of Americans – including even 79% of Republicans – believe that illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and are either enrolled in college or serving in the military should be allowed to remain (49% believe they should be granted citizenship). Obama’s policy differs from the one described in the poll, but only modestly. The small minority who oppose this move are unlikely to vote for Obama anyway. But regardless of his motives, Obama made the right decision. This policy ranks high on the list of issues where Obama and I agree.Some critics, such as John Yoo and Arnold Kling, attack the president’s decision not on the merits, but on the grounds that he lacks legal authority to choose not to enforce the law in this case.This criticism runs afoul of the reality that the federal government already chooses not to enforce its laws against the vast majority of those who violate them. Current federal criminal law is so expansive that the majority of Americans are probably federal criminals. That includes whole categories of people who get away with violating federal law because the president and the Justice Department believe that going after them isn’t worth the effort, and possibly morally dubious. For example, the feds almost never go after the hundreds of thousands of college students who are guilty of using illegal drugs in their dorms. The last three presidents of the United States all have reason to be grateful for this restraint.Yoo contends that there is a difference between using “prosecutorial discretion” to “choose priorities and prosecute cases that are the most important” and “refusing to enforce laws because of disagreements over policy.” I don’t think the distinction holds water. Policy considerations are inevitably among the criteria by which presidents and prosecutors “choose priorities” and decide which cases are “the most important.” One reason why the federal government has not launched a crackdown on illegal drug use in college dorms is precisely because they think it would be bad policy, and probably unjust to boot. That, of course, is very similar to Obama’s decision here. Finally, Yoo also argues that prosecutorial discretion does not allow the president to refuse to enforce an “entire law,” as opposed to merely doing so in specific cases. But Obama has not in fact refused to enforce the entire relevant law requiring deportation of illegal immigrants. He has simply chosen to do so with respect to people who fit certain specified criteria that the vast majority of illegal immigrants do not meet. Even if the president did choose to forego enforcement of an entire law, it’s not clear to me that that is outside the scope of prosecutorial discretion. A president who uses his discretion to “choose priorities” could reasonably conclude that enforcement of federal laws A, B, and C is so much more valuable than enforcement of D that no resources should be devoted to the latter if they could possibly be used for the former.UPDATE: A more recent poll shows that 64% of likely voters support the president’s policy.UPDATE #2: At the Originalism blog, Michael Ramsey comments on this post as follows:
These are all fair points, though I’m left with two questions:(1)  Where would Professor Somin draw the line between permissible non-enforcement and violation of the take care clause?  Could the President, if unable to persuade Congress to enact a middle-class tax cut, announce that henceforth people making below a specified income level will not be punished for failing to pay taxes?  I’d be surprised if many people think he could do that, but I’m having some trouble seeing how the present policy is different.(2) Is it true that all of the President’s policy can be explained simply as a decision not to enforce the law?  Professor Somin assumes so, but my limited understanding was that the policy conveys affirmative benefits.On Ramsey’s first question, I would say that the president could indeed choose not to  prosecute people making below a specified income for tax evasion. I think that is an inevitable result of a system of separation of powers where prosecutorial discretion is lodged in an executive separate from the legislature. The constraint on this kind of abuse of power is primarily political. A president who takes discretion too far risks a backlash by Congress and the public. Notice that the same scenario could arise from the use of the president’s pardon power. The president could announce that he will pardon anyone who is convicted of tax evasion if their annual income is below a certain level. No one doubts that the Constitution gives him such authority, and that the relevant constraint on it is mostly political. In reality, president’s are unlikely to massively abuse prosecutorial discretion for much the same reason as they are unlikely to pardon anyone who violates a federal law they disagree with. Regarding the second question, I am not aware of any “affirmative benefits” attached to Obama’s decision, other than those that are inevitably attached to being able to remain in the US. If there are such benefits, they may indeed raise legal issues that go beyond the issue of prosecutorial discretion.UPDATE #3: Ramsey responds further in an update to his post:Wow, so the President can lower everyone’s tax rates by executive order?  Why then did President Bush work so hard in 2001 to encourage Congress to enact the “Bush tax cuts” when he could have just announced that anyone who paid at the rate he specified wouldn’t be prosecuted?  Relatedly, does that mean the President can in effect adopt a (temporary) flat tax by saying that anyone who pays, say, 10% of income in taxes doesn’t need to worry about enforcement? More seriously, it seems to me that we face here two conflicting constitutional rules: the President’s Article II, Section 3, obligation to take care that the laws are faithfully executed and the President’s Article II, Section 1, executive power to decide how to enforce the law.  The challenge is to explain how they interact.  Professor Somin’s response seems instead simply to ignore one of them.  In posing my hypothetical, I was trying to draw out his explanation of the take care clause.  But perhaps he thinks that the President does not have an obligation to enforce the laws.  I’m not sure how that could be reconciled with the Constitution’s text, but I’m also not sure what other conclusion to draw from his response.On Ramsey’s first point, I would say that the reason why Bush worked to get Congress to pass his tax cuts is that, otherwise, any executive decision not to prosecute people could be overruled by the next president. Taxpayers would have no guarantee that the new Bush rates would not be suddenly changed by the president. Also, such a decision would have resulted in severe political damage to his administration. One can just as readily ask why Bush didn’t announce that he would pardon anyone convicted of failing to pay taxes above the rate Bush considered appropriate. As for the Take Care Clause, I don’t think it requires the president to enforce every law to the hilt. If it did, every single president in our history would have been in violation. In my view, what the Clause means is that the president (as opposed to Congress or the courts) is the official tasked with enforcing the laws and that he must make a good faith effort to decide on the best law enforcement strategy he can, given all relevant circumstances. That is not a perfect interpretation, but I think it’s preferable to the available alternatives.© 2019 The Volokh Conspiracy. All Rights Reserved. Powered by WordPress. Designed by President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deport most illegal
immigrants who encounter law enforcement, and Attorney General Jeff
Sessions is attempting to withhold federal funds from local police
departments that do not cooperate with DHS in that
effort.1 Underlying both actions is the belief
that illegal immigrants are a significant source of
crime.2 This brief uses Texas Department of
Public Safety data to measure the conviction and arrest rates of
illegal immigrants by crime. In Texas in 2015, the criminal
conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of
native-born Americans. Moreover, the conviction and arrest rates
for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born
Americans. This result holds for most crimes.The vast majority of research finds that immigrants do not
increase local crime rates and that they are less likely to cause
crime and less likely to be incarcerated than their native-born
peers.3 There is less research on illegal
immigrant criminality, but what research there is shows that
illegal immigrants have lower incarceration rates nationwide and in
the state of Texas relative to native-born Americans, although they
have the same rates of re-arrest in Los Angeles County.4 Consistent
with those findings, immigration enforcement programs targeting
illegal immigrant criminals have no effect on local crime rates,
which indicates that they are about as crime prone as other
residents.5Continue to full version This brief uses data from the Texas Department of Public Safety
(DPS) obtained through a Public Information Act (PIA)
request.6 The Texas DPS data separately show the
number of convictions and arrests of illegal and legal immigrants
for 44 and 46 different crimes, respectively, in the state of Texas
by year from January 1, 2011, to November 15, 2017. This brief
reports the conviction and arrest rates for each subpopulation of
natives, illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, and all immigrants
combined. This allows for a comparison of conviction and arrest
rates between these subpopulations. This brief additionally
displays conviction and arrest rates by select crimes.Texas has these data because its law enforcement agencies
cooperate with federal immigration enforcement authorities at the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that check the biometrics of
arrestees in the state.7 The Texas DPS keeps the results of these
DHS checks that then allow a more direct look at immigrant
criminality by immigration status.8 The DPS data released by the PIA
request revealed slightly more arrests in 2015 than were reported
by another publicly available DPS report for the same
year.9 The quality of the Texas DPS data is
excellent and, if it errs, it is likely to overcount the
convictions and arrests of illegal immigrants because it counts
more total arrests than another DPS source.This brief reports the conviction and arrest rates for 2015
because that is the most recent year for which estimates are
available for the sizes of the legal immigrant, native-born,
and illegal immigrant populations residing in the state of
Texas.10 The numbers in this brief do not
represent the total number of criminal immigrants in the state of
Texas in 2015, but merely the number of convictions and arrests of
illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, and natives. There were
22,797,819 native-born Americans, 1,758,199 illegal immigrants, and
2,913,096 legal immigrants living in Texas in 2015.11 In that
year, natives made up about 83 percent of the Texas population,
illegal immigrants about 6.4 percent of the population, and legal
immigrants about 10.6 percent. The conviction and arrest rates for
the entire period of January 1, 2011, through November 15, 2017,
are nearly identical to those of 2015, so the choice of year makes
little difference. The DPS data that this brief analyzes are for
all arrests and convictions that occurred in the year 2015,
regardless of the year in which the crime was actually
committed.Controlling for the size of the population is essential to
comparing relative conviction and arrest rates between groups.
Thus, government agencies generally report the conviction rate as
the number of convictions per 100,000 members of that particular
group.12 The three subgroups this brief analyzes
are illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, and native-born
Americans. It is important to note that the Texas DPS data report
the number of convictions and arrests, not the number of
people actually convicted or arrested. For instance, if a
Texas court convicts a single person of two different offenses or
of the same offense twice, then the Texas DPS data will count that
as two convictions.Texas is an ideal state to study criminality by immigration
status for multiple reasons: the state of Texas borders Mexico; it
has a large illegal immigrant population; it is a politically
conservative state governed by Republicans; in 2015 it did not have
jurisdictions that limited its cooperation with federal immigration
enforcement; and it has a law and order reputation for severely
enforcing its criminal laws.Natives were convicted of 409,708 crimes, illegal immigrants
were convicted of 15,803 crimes, and legal immigrants were
convicted of 17,785 crimes in Texas in 2015. Thus, there were 1,797
criminal convictions of natives for every 100,000 natives, 899
criminal convictions of illegal immigrants for every 100,000
illegal immigrants, and 611 criminal convictions of legal
immigrants for every 100,000 legal immigrants (Figure 1). As a
percentage of their respective populations, there were 50 percent
fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of
native-born Americans in Texas in 2015. The criminal conviction
rate for legal immigrants was about 66 percent below the
native-born rate.Homicides supposedly committed by illegal immigrants garner the
most public attention.13 On November 30, 2017, a San Francisco
jury acquitted José Inés García Zárate, an illegal immigrant from
Mexico previously deported five times, of murdering Kate
Steinle.14 Her tragic killing galvanized public
support for harsher immigration enforcement and the construction of
a border wall and provided anecdotal evidence for then-candidate
Trump’s claim that illegal immigrants are responsible for a large
number of crimes in the United States.15There were 785 total homicide convictions in Texas in 2015. Of
those, native-born Americans were convicted of 709 homicides,
illegal immigrants were convicted of 46 homicides, and legal
immigrants were convicted of 30 homicides. The homicide conviction
rate for native-born Americans was 3.1 per 100,000, 2.6 per 100,000
for illegal immigrants, and 1 per 100,000 for legal immigrants
(Figure 2). In 2015, homicide conviction rates for illegal and
legal immigrants were 16 percent and 67 percent below those of
natives, respectively.Illegal immigrants made up about 6.4 percent of the Texas
population in 2015 but only accounted for 5.9 percent of all
homicide convictions. Legal immigrants made up 10.6 percent of the
Texas population but accounted for only 3.8 percent of homicide
convictions. Native-born Americans made up 83 percent of the Texas
population but accounted for 90.3 percent of all homicide
convictions (Figure 3).Commentators also disproportionately blame immigrants for sex
assaults and sex offenses.16 This brief combines sexual assault and
sexual offense into the criminal category of sex crimes. There were
28.6 sex crime convictions of illegal immigrants per 100,000 in
2015, about 7.9 percent fewer than for native-born Americans in the
same year (Figure 4). The sex crime conviction rate for legal
immigrants was 69 percent below that of natives. There were many
fewer sex crime convictions against immigrants, including illegal
immigrants, than against native-born Americans in Texas in
2015.There were fewer larceny convictions of illegal immigrants and
legal immigrants than there were of natives in 2015. There were 267
larceny convictions of natives per 100,000 while there were only
about 62 convictions against illegal immigrants and 74 against
legal immigrants (Figure 5). The larceny conviction rate for
illegal immigrants was 77 percent below that of natives. This is
one of the few crimes where the criminal conviction rate of legal
immigrants is greater than it is for illegal immigrants.Some commentators argue that there is “immigrant privilege” in
the criminal justice system whereby immigrants face fewer criminal
convictions even though they are arrested for more
crimes.17 However, the arrest rate for illegal
immigrants is lower than for natives overall but higher for just a
handful of individual crimes-very similar to the conviction rate.
Lower arrest rates for illegal immigrants overturns the “immigrant
privilege” hypothesis.In 2015, Texas police made 815,689 arrests of natives, 37,776
arrests of illegal immigrants, and 20,323 arrests of legal
immigrants. For every 100,000 people in each subgroup, there were
3,578 arrests of natives, 2,149 arrests of illegal immigrants, and
698 arrests of legal immigrants (Table 1). The arrest rate for
illegal immigrants was 40 percent below that of native-born
Americans. The arrest rate for all immigrants and legal immigrants
was 65 percent and 81 percent below that of native-born Americans,
respectively.Per 100,000 people in their respective groups, there were more
arrests of natives for homicide, sex crimes, and larceny than there
were arrests of illegal immigrants.The homicide conviction rate for illegal immigrants was 16
percent below that of native-born Americans in Texas in 2015. The
conviction rates for illegal immigrants were 7.9 percent and 77
percent below that of native-born Americans for sex crimes and
larceny, respectively. For all criminal convictions in Texas in
2015, illegal immigrants had a criminal conviction rate 50 percent
below that of native-born Americans. Legal immigrants had a
criminal conviction rate 66 percent below that of native-born
Americans.1 “Executive Order: Enhancing

By
Chris Nichols
on Thursday, August 3rd, 2017 at 4:04 p.m.
Candidate for California governor Antonio Villaraigosa jumped into the nation’s heated debate on immigration reform during a recent interview on MSNBC.The Democrat and former Los Angeles mayor rejected the idea that deporting undocumented immigrants was a sound strategy for reducing crime.His statement followed President Trump’s speech about combatting MS-13 gang members. The gang started in poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. It’s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000.Trump campaigned on the promise to deport millions of undocumented residents, often describing them as threats to public safety.Here’s what Villaraigosa said on July 31, 2017 on MSNBC."I think we all agree that people that commit violent crimes ought to be deported. But going after the undocumented is not a crime strategy, when you look at the fact that the National Academy of Sciences in, I think it was November of 2015, the undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born. That’s just a fact."Watch the interview here. We decided to examine this last point as part of our Tracking The Truth series, which fact-checks claims in the 2018 California governor's race.We interpreted Villaraigosa’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born.But we wondered whether this was really a settled matter.We set out on a fact check.Our researchWe started by checking out the 2015 National Academy of Sciences study Villaraigosa cited. It found: "Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates." The study added that "This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men."It continued: "Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by ‘issue entrepreneurs’ who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy."The academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government.Findings in a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support Villaraigosa's statement:"Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal immigrants are 69 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal and illegal immigrants are underrepresented in the incarcerated population while natives are overrepresented."The Cato study used information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for immigrants aged 18 to 54 who are incarcerated in the United States. To examine Villaraigosa's claim, we also relied on research into similar claims by our partner national PolitiFact. In July 2016, it rated Mostly True a statement by Libertarian candidate for president Gary Johnson that Mexican immigrants "are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic."PolitiFact found several studies that back up this claim by citing incarceration rates. It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed.PolitiFact’s findingsPolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.Looking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented. U.S.-born men are incarcerated in the state at a rate of more than two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California.The American Immigration Council also reported that 2010 Census data shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are "significantly lower" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma.Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said.Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors."They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," he told PolitiFact. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence."Crime trendsPolitiFact also noted that as the immigrant population has increased, crime has gone down, citing Ewing’s report.Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, the violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data.Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens."The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research," Bersani said.According to Bersani’s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations)."This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population," Bersani said.Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available.More research needed?The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime "remains confused" due to lack of data and contrary information.Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said.As PolitiFact reported in 2015, there isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated.PolitiFact California spoke about this critique with Ewing of the American Immigration Council, whose research supports Villaraigosa’s claim. He said he’s confident in the work that’s been done and said critics have used anecdotes, rather than full-blown research, to try to make their points.Ewing added that the studies backing up Villaraigosa’s statement are "from such a wide range of researchers using so many different methodologies and sources of data -- not everyone can be wrong."Our rulingVillaraigosa said "undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born."He cited a 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences that backs up this claim.In a fact check last year, PolitiFact rated a similar claim Mostly True. It cited additional studies by scholars and partisan groups that show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born.It also found that researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime. It said this was a needed clarification.PolitiFact California agrees with these findings.We rated Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True.MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.UPDATE: We have added information to the ‘Our research’ section of this fact check from a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute. The study’s findings provide additional evidence backing up Villaraigosa’s claim that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native born.PolitiFact California is fact-checking claims in the 2018 California governor's race through our Tracking The Truth series. Hear a claim you want fact-checked?

                        If my nephew’s ideas on immigration had been in force a century ago, our family would have been wiped out.
                    By DAVID S. GLOSSERAugust 13, 2018Dr. David S. Glosser is a retired neuropsychologist: formerly a member of the Neurology faculties of Boston University School of Medicine and Jefferson Medical College.Let me tell you a story about Stephen Miller and chain migration.It begins at the turn of the 20th century, in a dirt-floor shack in the village of Antopol, a shtetl of subsistence farmers in what is now Belarus. Beset by violent anti-Jewish pogroms and forced childhood conscription in the Czar’s army, the patriarch of the shack, Wolf-Leib Glosser, fled a village where his forebears had lived for centuries and took his chances in America.Story Continued BelowHe set foot on Ellis Island on January 7, 1903, with $8 to his name. Though fluent in Polish, Russian and Yiddish, he understood no English. An elder son, Nathan, soon followed. By street corner peddling and sweatshop toil, Wolf-Leib and Nathan sent enough money home to pay off debts and buy the immediate family’s passage to America in 1906. That group included young Sam Glosser, who with his family settled in the western Pennsylvania city of Johnstown, a booming coal and steel town that was a magnet for other hardworking immigrants. The Glosser family quickly progressed from selling goods from a horse and wagon to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown run by Nathan and Wolf-Leib to a chain of supermarkets and discount department stores run by my grandfather, Sam, and the next generation of Glossers, including my dad, Izzy. It was big enough to be listed on the AMEX stock exchange and employed thousands of people over time. In the span of some 80 years and five decades, this family emerged from poverty in a hostile country to become a prosperous, educated clan of merchants, scholars, professionals, and, most important, American citizens. What does this classically American tale have to do with Stephen Miller? Well, Izzy Glosser is his maternal grandfather, and Stephen’s mother, Miriam, is my sister.I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, an educated man who is well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country.I shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses— the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents, and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants — been in effect when Wolf-Leib made his desperate bid for freedom. The Glossers came to the U.S. just a few years before the fear and prejudice of the “America first” nativists of the day closed U.S. borders to Jewish refugees. Had Wolf-Leib waited, his family likely would have been murdered by the Nazis along with all but seven of the 2,000 Jews who remained in Antopol. I would encourage Stephen to ask himself if the chanting, torch-bearing Nazis of Charlottesville, whose support his boss seems to court so cavalierly, do not envision a similar fate for him.

True, Jews were excluded from many occupations, couldn’t buy homes in some towns, couldn’t join certain organizations or attend certain schools or universities, but life was good. As in past generations, there were hate mongers who regarded the most recent groups of poor immigrants as scum, rapists, gangsters, drunks and terrorists, but largely the Glosser family was left alone to live our lives and build the American dream. Children were born, synagogues founded, and we thrived. This was the miracle of America. Acting for so long in the theater of right-wing politics, Stephen and Trump may have become numb to the resultant human tragedy and blind to the hypocrisy of their policy decisions. After all, Stephen’s is not the only family with a chain immigration story in the Trump administration. Trump's grandfather is reported to have been a German migrant on the run from military conscription to a new life in the United States, and his mother fled the poverty of rural Scotland for the economic possibilities of New York City. (Trump’s in-laws just became citizens on the strength of his wife’s own citizenship.) These facts are important not only for their grim historical irony but because vulnerable people are being hurt. They are real people, not the ghoulish caricatures portrayed by Trump. When confronted by the deaths and suffering of thousands, our senses are overwhelmed, and the victims become statistics rather than people. I meet these statistics one at a time through my volunteer service as a neuropsychologist for the Philadelphia affiliate of HIAS (formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), the global nonprofit that protects refugees and helped my family more than 100 years ago. I will share the story of one such man I have met in the hopes that my nephew might recognize elements of our shared heritage.

                    By POLITICO MAGAZINEIn the early 2000s, Joseph (not his real name) was conscripted at the age of 14 to be a soldier in Eritrea and sent to a remote desert military camp. Officers there discovered a Bible under his pillow which aroused their suspicion that he might belong to a foreign evangelical sect that would claim his loyalty and sap his will to fight. Joseph was actually a member of the state-approved Coptic church but was nonetheless immediately subjected to torture. “They smashed my face into the ground, tied my hands and feet together behind my back, stomped on me, and hung me from a tree by my bonds while they beat me with batons for the others to see.” Joseph was tortured for 20 consecutive days before being taken to a military prison and crammed into a dark unventilated cell with 36 other men, little food and no proper hygiene. Some died, and in time Joseph was stricken with dysentery. When he was too weak to stand, he was taken to a civilian clinic where he was fed by the medical staff. Upon regaining his strength, he escaped to a nearby road where a sympathetic driver took him north through the night to a camp in Sudan where he joined other refugees. Joseph was on the first leg of a journey that would cover thousands of miles and almost 10 years.Before Donald Trump had started his political ascent promulgating the false story that Barack Obama was a foreign-born Muslim, while my nephew, Stephen, was famously recovering from the hardships of his high school cafeteria in Santa Monica, Joseph was a child on his own in Sudan in fear of being deported back to Eritrea to face execution for desertion. He worked any job he could get, saved his money and made his way through Sudan. He endured arrest and extortion in Libya. He returned to Sudan, then kept moving to Dubai, Brazil and eventually to a southern border crossing into Texas, where he sought asylum. In all of the countries he traveled through during his ordeal, he was vulnerable, exploited and his status was “illegal.” But in the United States, he had a chance to acquire the protection of a documented immigrant. 
Swamp Diary
                    By JACK SHAFERToday, at 30, Joseph lives in Pennsylvania and has a wife and child. He is a smart, warm, humble man of great character who is grateful for every day of his freedom and safety. He bears emotional scars from not seeing his parents or siblings since he was 14. He still trembles, cries and struggles for breath when describing his torture, and he bears physical scars as well. He hopes to become a citizen, return to work and make his contribution to America. His story, though unique in its particulars, is by no means unusual. I have met Central Americans fleeing corrupt governments, violence and criminal extortion; a Yemeni woman unable to return to her war-ravaged home country and fearing sexual mutilation if she goes back to her Saudi husband; and an escaped kidnap-bride from central Asia. Trump wants to make us believe that these desperate migrants are an existential threat to the United States; the most powerful nation in world history and a nation made strong by immigrants. Trump and my nephew both know their immigrant and refugee roots. Yet, they repeat the insults and false accusations of earlier generations against these refugees to make them seem less than human. Trump publicly parades the grieving families of people hurt or killed by migrants, just as the early Nazis dredged up Jewish criminals to frighten and enrage their political base to justify persecution of all Jews. Almost every American family has an immigration story of its own based on flight from war, poverty, famine, persecution, fear or hopelessness. Most of these immigrants became workers, entrepreneurs, scientists and soldiers of America. Most damning is the administration's evident intent to make policy that specifically disadvantages people based on their ethnicity, country of origin and religion. No matter what opinion is held about immigration, any government that specifically enacts law or policy on that basis must be recognized as a threat to all of us. Laws bereft of justice are the gateway to tyranny. Today others may be the target, but tomorrow it might just as easily be you or me. History will be the judge, but in the meantime the normalization of these policies is rapidly eroding the collective conscience of America. Immigration reform is a complex issue that will require compassion and wisdom to bring the nation to a just solution, but the politicians who have based their political and professional identity on ethnic demonization and exclusion cannot be trusted to do so. As free Americans, and descendants of immigrants and refugees, we have the obligation to exercise our conscience by voting for candidates who will stand up for our highest national values and not succumb to our lowest fears.Optics

 © 2019 POLITICO LLCAdvertisementSupported byBy Julia PrestonA federal judge in California has ruled that the Obama administration’s detention of children and their mothers who were caught crossing the border illegally is a serious violation of a longstanding court settlement, and that the families should be released as quickly as possible.In a decision late Friday roundly rejecting the administration’s arguments for holding the families, Judge Dolly M. Gee of Federal District Court for the Central District of California found that two detention centers in Texas that the administration opened last summer fail to meet minimum legal requirements of the 1997 settlement for facilities housing children.Judge Gee also found that migrant children had been held in “widespread deplorable conditions” in Border Patrol stations after they were first caught, and she said the authorities had “wholly failed” to provide the “safe and sanitary” conditions required for children even in temporary cells.The opinion was a significant legal blow to detention policies ordered by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in response to an influx of children and parents, mostly from Central America, across the border in South Texas last summer. In her 25-page ruling, Judge Gee gave a withering critique of the administration’s positions, declaring them “unpersuasive” and “dubious” and saying officials had ignored “unambiguous” terms of the settlement.The administration has struggled with a series of setbacks in the federal courts for its immigration policies, including decisions that halted President Obama’s programs to give protection from deportation and work permits to millions of undocumented immigrants. “We are disappointed with the court’s decision and are reviewing it in consultation with the Department of Justice,” said Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security. She said officials would respond to an order by the judge to present a plan by Aug. 3 for carrying out the ruling. Judge Gee’s decision was based on the 18-year-old settlement in a hard-fought class action lawsuit, known as Flores, that has governed the treatment of minors apprehended at the border who are unaccompanied — not with a parent. Judge Gee found that the Flores settlement, which has been carried out with little dispute from the federal authorities, also applies to children caught with their parents.The judge also found that the family detention centers in Texas were a “material breach” of provisions requiring that minors be placed in facilities that are not secured like prisons and are licensed to take care of children. The detention centers are secure facilities run by private prison contractors.She ruled on a lawsuit that was filed in February by Peter Schey and Carlos Holguin, lawyers at the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law in Los Angeles. They sued after two months of negotiations between them and the Justice Department produced no accord on how to change the detention centers.“I think this spells the beginning of the end for the Obama administration’s immigrant family detention policy,” Mr. Schey, the president of the human rights center, said Friday. “A policy that just targets mothers with children is not rational and it’s inhumane.”The detention of the mothers and children has drawn furious criticism from immigrant advocates and religious and Latino groups, who have called on the administration to shut the detention centers down.Since last summer’s surge, Homeland Security officials opened detention centers in Texas in Dilley and Karnes City, in addition to a small family center already operating in Berks County, Pa. As of June 30, about 2,600 women and children were held in the three centers, officials said.Initially, Homeland Security officials said they were detaining the families to send a message to others in Central America to deter them from coming to the United States illegally. In February, a federal court in Washington, D.C., ruled that strategy unconstitutional. Officials stopped invoking deterrence as a factor in deciding whether to release mothers and children as they seek asylum in the United States.But many women and children remained stalled behind bleak walls and fences month after month with no end in sight. Mothers became severely depressed or anxious, and their distress echoed in their children, who became worried and sickly.Under the Flores settlement, officials were required to try first to release a child to a parent, legal guardian or close relative. Judge Gee concluded that if the mother was also detained, Homeland Security officials should release her with the child, as long as she did not present a flight or security risk. She gave the administration one week to devise a plan to release children and mothers “without unnecessary delay.”For children who could not be released, the Flores agreement required officials to place them in nonsecure facilities run by agencies licensed for child care.On June 24, Mr. Johnson announced changes to shorten the length of stay for most women and children in the centers. The pace of releases picked up, and more than 150 women and children were freed in one week alone in early July. Officials argued in recent court filings that Judge Gee was ruling on practices no longer in place.Advocates disagreed.“This decision confirms that the mass detention of refugee children and their mothers violates U.S. law,” said Elora Mukherjee, a law professor at Columbia University who with her students has represented women at the Texas detention centers. “Prolonging their detention even a single day in light of this decision would be illegal.”Advertisement

                    By JOSH GERSTEIN06/29/2018 09:41 PM EDT
                    Updated 06/30/2018 08:32 AM EDTJust days after President Donald Trump announced that his administration would ask a federal court to permit detention of immigrant families by modifying a longstanding court settlement, Justice Department lawyers told the Los Angeles-based judge handling the case Friday that no change to the decree may be needed. Trump administration lawyers argued that a separate injunction a federal judge in San Diego issued Tuesday barring family separations effectively wipes out provisions in the decades-old Flores agreement that have been determined to bar detention of most children in immigration custody for more than 20 days.Story Continued Below “The rulings work together to permit detention of parents with their minor children with whom they are apprehended,” Justice Department attorneys wrote in a submission to U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who oversees the 31-year-old Flores agreement on the treatment of immigrant children. The filing appears to leave open one key question: What becomes of the Flores agreement's requirement that children be held in state-licensed day care facilities?  Federal authorities say a family detention center in Pennsylvania has such approvals, but two other centers in Texas do not. In addition, federal officials are crafting plans to hold some families in makeshift centers yet to be constructed on military bases, which don't have such approval and may not be able to get it anytime soon.Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The government's filing Friday treats that issue in a footnote, but it could become a major sticking point. “The issue regarding how the Flores Agreement licensing provisions apply to family detention centers is the subject of ongoing litigation,” Justice Department attorneys wrote. “We have also asked this Court to modify the Agreement to permit the transfer of families together to family residential centers without requiring a state license.” Thorny questions also remain about parents’ rights under the two court orders. The government notes that the injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw suggests that keeping families together is the default position, with parents permitted to agree to release of a child to another family member. However, lawyers advocating for children under the Flores agreement have typically he issue differently, saying that a child should be placed in the community unless parents affirmatively agree to them remaining in detention.“The Trump Administration has been engaged — since January of 2017–in restoring order to the lawlessness at the southwest border and protecting our nation’s citizens, but we are beholden to a broken immigration system that Congress has refused to fix and that courts have exacerbated,” a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement. “While Congress has recessed for the 4th of July holiday, we continue to urge them to act decisively in order to solve the crisis at our border and end ‘catch and release.’”The Justice Department's position gives supremacy to the injunction Sabraw issued Tuesday, while the decades-old Flores agreement oriented toward release of children has been interpreted by not only Gee but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to require release of accompanied and unaccompanied minors within 20 days. 
Congress
                    By ELANA SCHOR Immigration advocates in both cases have suggested parents should have a right to opt to keep their families together, but no court has specifically endorsed a right to opt-out of Flores' release requirements. Despite the government's position that the current state of play in the two legal cases allows the detention of immigrant families, Justice Department lawyers said in their pleading Friday that the government continues "to believe that an amendment to the agreement is appropriate to address this issue." Late Friday night, immigrant rights advocates involved in the Flores case responded to the government's submission last week asking Gee to end the consent decree's provisions requiring release of immigrant children. No change to the pact is needed, the lawyers pressing the class-action case said."Modifying the agreement to strip accompanied class members of the right to reasonably prompt release would not improve Defendants’ ability to keep families together. It would permit Defendants to force families to stay together in unlicensed facilities by eliminating class members’ right – subject to opt out by a parent – to be released or placed under the terms of the Agreement," the immigrant children's attorneys wrote.The immigrant rights' lawyers also dispute the Trump administration's claims that it is facing a massive surge of family migration. They say a recent inspection by one of their lawyers found the 2,400-bed Dilley, Texas, family detention facility to have more than 800 beds unoccupied. The attorneys also reject the notion that children's right to release encourages migration to the U.S."The Settlement has been in effect since 1997, yet Defendants offer no evidence establishing that its enforcement now encourages others to enter the United States without authorization. In any event, deterring others is simply not a lawful basis to refuse anyone release, much less vulnerable children," the lawyers wrote.One lawyer close to the case said Friday night that immigrant parents could waive their rights under Flores in order to keep their children with them, but could not be compelled to waive their right to have their child placed in a licensed center. Such a stance could flummox Trump's new family detention policy by giving authorities two stark choices the administration has said it wants to avoid: release the adult or break up the family. An attorney who argued for the injunction in the San Diego case, which is known as Ms. L., said that order does not require Trump to put families in extended detention. “The government's suggestion that the Flores settlement and the Ms. L case are in conflict is false,” said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union. “Neither the Ms. L case nor the Flores settlement remotely requires long term family detention, because the government can and constitutionally must release parents who do not pose a flight risk or danger. Moreover, as the government recognizes, notwithstanding the Ms. L case, parents can always choose to release their children if they do not want them to remain in a family detention center. Ultimately the Ms. L case leaves it up to parents to decide what is in the best interests of the child. Additionally, it would be flatly unconstitutional if the government's purpose in detaining families is punitive or is intended to serves as a deterrent.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

    FNC's Griff Jenkins provides the latest details.Illegal immigrants appeared to have “ambushed” two U.S. Border Patrol agents near the Texas border with Mexico and bashed their heads with blunt objects -- possibly rocks -- killing one agent and sending another to a hospital in serious condition Sunday, a National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) official told Fox News.Rogelio Martinez, 36, was killed and another agent, who has not been identified, was injured while they were patrolling the Big Bend Sector, leading authorities to scour West Texas for the attackers, officials said. Although few details about the incident have been released, Brandon Judd, the president of the NBPC, told Fox News on Monday it appeared Martinez and the second agent were “ambushed” by a group of illegal immigrants.“We don’t know exactly what happened because we weren’t there. However, just from agents that were working in the area, reports are saying it was an attack and it would appear to be an ambush,” Judd said.He added: “There’s a high likelihood this was an assault on the agents.”
      Rogelio Martinez, 36, was killed while patrolling the Big Bend Sector in Texas.
      (Facebook)Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has offered a reward of up to $20,000 "for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible" for the attack.Martinez and his partner suffered traumatic injuries to the head and other injuries such as broken bones, FBI El paso said in a news release. Judd earlier told Fox News Martinez died of blunt force trauma to the head, indicating the attackers most likely used a rock or rocks during the assault on the two agents. The area surrounding where the attack occurred also indicated rocks were likely used as weapons. An FBI official also said that, counter to initial reports, neither agent was shot.“There were no indications the agents fired their weapons,” Judd said, citing accounts he received from agents who responded to the incident. He also said there were no signs of a stabbing.Martinez was notified there was illegal immigrant traffic in the area while the agents were patrolling near Interstate 10, in the Van Horn Station area, according to Judd. He began following “footprints” on a trail when the attack occurred. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a news release that Martinez&aposs partner made the initial call for help and reported they were injured and needed assistance.“There’s a high likelihood this was an assault on the agents.”Judd said details remained foggy on what led to the ambush and the FBI was investigating the incident.Judd did not further comment on the second agent’s condition.Martinez was from El Paso and had worked as a border agent since August 2013, assigned to the Big Bend Sector. He was also a father and brother, KFOX14 reported.Border Patrol records showed the agency&aposs Big Bend sector, which includes the area where Sunday&aposs attack took place, accounted for about 1 percent of the more than 61,000 apprehensions its agents made along the Southwest border between October 2016 and May 2017. The region&aposs mountains make it a difficult area for people to cross illegally into the U.S. from Mexico.The Border Patrol website lists 38 agents, not including Martinez, who have died since late 2003 — some attacked while working along the border and others killed in traffic accidents. Martinez is the second agent to have died this year.President Trump tweeted Sunday night: "Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border, another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!"The Associated Press contributed to this report. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.Keep Me Logged In  Tea-party activist Sal Russo offered an eye-opening remark this week. He said: "Conservatives should be leaders in the immigration-reform movement." Then tax-reform activist Grover Norquist organized a media conference call in which he reinforced his support of immigration reform. American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas joined in that call, as did Robert Gittelson, president of Conservatives for Comprehensive Immigration Reform.   In recent days, support for legal status for undocumented immigrants was also voiced by Sen. Rand Paul, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, all GOP presidential contenders.    House Speaker John Boehner has denied making any clear commitment to the White House to overhaul immigration, distrustful that President Barack Obama will enforce a deal combining border security with legalization and possibly citizenship. But Boehner has laid down clear immigration-reform principles that have proven widely popular.   So the political tide among conservatives and Republicans may be turning in favor of immigration reform. As a longtime supporter of reform who believes that immigration is a pro-growth issue—I am delighted to see these developments.    If the GOP is to recapture the Senate come November and move on to retake the presidency in 2016, it must have a strong pro-growth message. Jobs and the economy are going to be key issues. Tax reform, regulatory rollbacks and a rewriting of Obamacare that ends the mandates and provides real health-care freedom to choose are vital points.   But so is the immigration issue.    Not only because it is pro-growth, but because the Republican Party must return to its big tent roots. It must follow the lead of Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp. It must reach out to Latinos, African-Americans, young people and women. A conservative Catholic like myself can work inside the same tent as my Log Cabin Republican friends.Read MoreRepublican leaders to block immigration measure  In doing so, the GOP can maintain its core conservative principles of economic growth, limited government and military strength. As Reagan taught us, strength at home in the domestic economy is vital to strength abroad in national security. That must not change. Nor should the GOP's longtime support for defending the life of the unborn.   But the GOP will not be successful unless it actively reaches out to groups that have recently deserted it. It must show independents and disaffected Democrats that the Republican Party is open for business, ready to spread its wings to attract greater support.   Immigration reform is a crucial symbol in the GOP reach-out effort. It will create new trust in a party that can govern for all.    All the recent polls say immigration reform is popular. A survey by the Partnership for a New American Economy shows that around 70 percent of Republicans who identify with the tea-party movement support immigration reform. They back the idea of undocumented immigrants obtaining either legalization or a path to citizenship. And 76 percent of surveyed Republicans support improved border security and letting immigrants remain in the U.S., while 69 percent say they would also support a candidate who backs broad reform. Read MoreImmigration, wage reforms near: Obama advisor  Other polls from Gallup, CNN/ORC, Fox News, and CBS News agree. In fact, the Fox News poll indicates that more than two-thirds of Americans support a pathway to citizenship and reject mass deportation.    As Russo, co-founder of the Tea Party Express, put it, "We need to make the 11 million people who are here illegally obey the law, pay taxes and come out of the shadows. We have to get them right by the law in exchange for legal status, but not unbridled amnesty. This should include penalties, background checks to root out criminals and the requirement that they learn English, understand the Constitution and be committed to our basic freedoms. We must ensure there is no special pathway to citizenship that puts them in front of people who waited in line."   There's no reason why this can't be done.   Republican economist and former Congressional budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin argues that more rapid overall population growth will generate more rapid GDP growth and increased productivity. He notes that labor-force participation rates are higher among the foreign-born, and suggests that real GDP growth could rise from 3 percent to 3.9 percent on average annually over the first 10 post-reform years, reducing the budget deficit by nearly $3 trillion.     What's more, immigration restrictionists are wrong to cite a CBO estimate that increased immigration will cost jobs. Yes, there could be a minor 0.1 percent transitory uptick in the unemployment rate. Meaningless. Over the longer term, the CBO agrees with Holtz-Eakin's conclusions.    Pro-growth immigration reform will strengthen the shaky economy. Politically it will help the shaky GOP. And on the road to capturing all three houses in Washington in 2016, it will send a new message about a new Republican Party.  —By CNBC's Larry Kudlow; Follow him on Twitter @larry_kudlow Got a confidential news tip?

Donate Hispanic TrendsNumber from Mexico continues to decline, while Central America is the only growing regionBy Jeffrey S. Passel and D’Vera CohnThe number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in more than a decade, according to new Pew Research Center estimates based on 2016 government data. The decline is due almost entirely to a sharp decrease in the number of Mexicans entering the country without authorization.But the Mexican border remains a pathway for entry by growing numbers of unauthorized immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Because of them, Central America was the only birth region accounting for more U.S. unauthorized immigrants in 2016 than in 2007.There were 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2016, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007, according to the new estimates.The total is the lowest since 2004. It is tied to a decline of 1.5 million people in the number of Mexican unauthorized immigrants from 2007 to 2016. Nevertheless, Mexico remains the country of origin for 5.4 million unauthorized immigrants, or roughly half of the U.S. total.The declining overall number of unauthorized immigrants is due mainly to a very large drop in the number of new unauthorized immigrants, especially Mexicans, coming into the country. Consequently, today’s unauthorized immigrant population includes a smaller share of recent arrivals, especially from Mexico, than a decade earlier. Increasingly unauthorized immigrants are likely to be long-term U.S. residents: Two-thirds of adult unauthorized immigrants have lived in the country for more than 10 years.As overall numbers declined, other related changes occurred in the unauthorized immigrant population. Between 2007 and 2016, the number of unauthorized immigrant workers fell, as did their share of the total U.S. workforce over the same period. So did the number of unauthorized immigrant men in the prime working ages of 18 to 44, but not women in that age group.As their typical span of U.S. residence has grown, a rising share of unauthorized immigrant adults – 43% in 2016 compared with 32% in 2007 – live in households with U.S.-born children.Pew Research Center bases the estimates in this report on a “residual method” similar to those employed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics and nongovernmental organizations, such as the Center for Migration Studies and the Migration Policy Institute. Those organizations’ estimates are generally consistent with ours. Our estimates also align with official U.S. data sources, including birth records, school enrollment figures and tax data, as well as Mexican censuses and surveys.The first step in our method is to use U.S. census counts and government surveys, such as the American Community Survey, to calculate how many immigrants live in the U.S. in a particular year. Next, we use official counts of immigrant admissions and other demographic data (death rates, for example) to determine how many of these immigrants live in the U.S. legally. Then we subtract those lawful immigrants from the total to get an estimate of the unauthorized immigrant population.Based on experience and research, we know the census counts and other official surveys tend to miss some people. Unauthorized immigrants are especially likely to be missed. Therefore, we do a further assessment of potential undercounts or undercoverage. Based on this additional research, our final estimate of the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population includes an upward adjustment for undercount.For more details, see Methodology.Mexico’s historical significance as a source of U.S. immigration – authorized and especially unauthorized – overshadows that of other parts of the world, even after a decade of decline in unauthorized immigrants from that country. (For this reason, Mexico is treated as both a region and a country in this report for comparison purposes.) In the past decade, the number of unauthorized immigrants from South America and from Canada and Europe, combined, has declined, although by a smaller amount than from Mexico.In the opposite direction, the number of unauthorized immigrants from Central America increased by 375,000 over the same 2007 to 2016 period. The 1.85 million Central American unauthorized immigrants in 2016 mainly came from the three Northern Triangle nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, all of which registered increases since 2007.Among the 20 largest birth countries, unauthorized immigrant totals also grew from India and Venezuela over the 2007-16 period. Meanwhile, there were statistically significant declines from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Korea and Peru.Overall, between 2007 and 2016, the unauthorized immigrant population shrank by 13%. By contrast, the lawful immigrant population grew 22% during the same period, an increase of more than 6 million people. In 2016, the U.S. was home to a total of 34.4 million lawful immigrants, both naturalized citizens and noncitizens on permanent and temporary visas.1Pew Research Center’s estimate of the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population includes more than a million people who have temporary permission to stay and work in the U.S. under two programs that could be rescinded, potentially exposing them to deportation.As of Aug. 31, 2018, nearly 700,000 young adults who came to the U.S. illegally as children were recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. DACA was created by the Obama administration in 2012; the Trump administration announced in 2017 that the program would end, but it has been kept alive by court challenges.At least 317,000 people from 10 nations benefit from Temporary Protected Status, which is granted to visitors from countries where natural disaster or violence make it difficult to return. The Department of Homeland Security has announced plans to end protections for immigrants from six nations, including El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, which account for the vast majority of the total.The unauthorized immigrant estimates in this report also include some immigrants who applied for asylum status but whose applications had not yet been processed.2Not all unauthorized immigrants enter the U.S. without documents, as is true of most Mexicans and Central Americans. Many arrive with legal visas but overstay their required departure date. Among unauthorized immigrants in the Center’s estimates who arrived in the previous five years, the share who are likely to be people who overstayed their visas probably grew substantially between 2007 and 2016 – to the point where they probably constituted most of the recent unauthorized immigrant arrivals in 2016.The reference to “likely overstays” reflects the limits of the U.S. Census Bureau data that are the basis for these estimates; census data do not indicate whether unauthorized immigrants arrived with legal visas. But there is growing evidence about immigrants with expired visas from recent analyses by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which has produced three annual reports since 2016 analyzing statistics on the origins of immigrants who overstay and the types of visas they held. The latest report, for the 2017 fiscal year, estimated that more than 700,000 overstays should have left sometime during the year ending Sept. 30, 2017.These official figures do not cover all arrivals and encompass only three years of data, which are not entirely comparable. For these and other reasons, they do not offer enough information on their own to say with certainty whether the overstay rate is growing, stable or declining. They do, however, indicate where the overstays are from. In contrast to border apprehensions, where 95% or more of immigrants are from Mexico and Central America, the vast majority of overstays – almost 90% – are from elsewhere.A key indicator of the probable rise in the share of overstays among the unauthorized immigrant population comes from a Pew Research Center analysis comparing government overstay estimates and border apprehension statistics. For Mexico, there were almost four times as many apprehensions as overstays, even with the very large drops in Mexican apprehensions. For the three Northern Triangle nations, there were about 10 times as many apprehensions as overstays in 2015-17 government data.For virtually every other country, overstays substantially exceed apprehensions.3 Taken together, for the rest of the world, the number of overstays was more than 30 times the number of border apprehensions.The new Pew Research Center estimates indicate that not only is the total number of unauthorized immigrants shrinking, but that population includes markedly fewer people who arrived in the previous five years. Only 20% of all unauthorized immigrants (including both adults and children) in 2016 had arrived in the previous five years, compared with 32% in 2007.An analysis of annual arrival flows for the years leading up to 2007 and 2016, using U.S. Census Bureau data, illustrates the downward trend in recently arrived unauthorized immigrants. There was an average of 386,000 annual arrivals for the 2011-16 period, compared with 715,000 for the 2002-07 period. That amounts to a 46% decline.Increasingly, unauthorized immigrants are long-term U.S. residents. By 2016, an unauthorized immigrant adult had typically lived in the U.S. for 14.8 years, compared with a median 8.6 years in 2007.The fall in recent arrivals is especially true for Mexicans – only 9% of unauthorized immigrants in 2016 had come to the U.S. in the previous five years, about half the share in the overall unauthorized immigrant population. Mexicans also were only about a quarter of all recent arrivals in 2016 compared with fully half in 2007.The number of recent arrivals from regions other than Mexico also declined, but less sharply. So as Mexicans became a shrinking share of recent arrivals, the share of all unauthorized immigrants who had arrived from Asia within the previous five years increased from 13% in 2007 to 22% in 2016. The share from the Northern Triangle nations in Central America grew from 11% to 18%. In addition, the share from the rest of the world (other than Asia, Central America and Mexico) rose to more than a third of recent arrivals in 2016, compared with about a quarter in 2007.Apprehensions at the border do not exactly match attempts at unlawful entry, but enforcement officials and researchers view them as an indicator of entries. Annual apprehensions (sometimes the same person is caught more than once) peaked in 2000 at about 1.7 million before declining sharply. There were about 310,000 apprehensions in fiscal 2017, which includes part of the 2016 calendar year covered by these estimates.4The border apprehensions are almost all attempted entries by Mexicans and Central Americans from the three Northern Triangle countries; people from those four nations accounted for 95% of apprehensions in 2017 and 98% in 2007. Mexicans accounted for about 130,000 apprehensions in 2017, more than those from any other single country. This represents the smallest number of apprehensions of Mexicans since 1968 and is a drop of more than 80% from the 809,000 Mexicans apprehended in 2007, another indicator of the decline of Mexican unauthorized immigrants.Meanwhile, apprehensions of Central Americans from the Northern Triangle more than tripled from 54,000 in 2007 to 165,000 in 2017 (but was still well below the peak of 239,000 in fiscal 2014). In fact, Northern Triangle apprehensions exceeded border apprehensions of Mexicans in 2014, 2016 and 2017 – something that had never happened before and which corroborates the rise in Central American unauthorized immigrants in the Center’s estimates. These apprehensions include those of unaccompanied children and families with children.Deportations also can have an impact in limiting the size and growth of the unauthorized immigrant population. Deportations rose during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations – from 211,000 in 2003 to a record 433,000 in 2013, according to Department of Homeland Security statistics. They remained well above 300,000 a year through fiscal 2016, the last full year for which numbers are available. The vast majority of those deported were from Mexico and the three Northern Triangle nations in Central America.Deportations appear to have declined since then, based on limited statistics. The number of immigrants deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement within DHS – “removed” in government wording – declined 17% between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, which ended Sept. 30, 2017. Nearly 230,000 unauthorized immigrants were removed, which included a decline in those detained at the U.S.-Mexico border as well as an increase in those arrested in the interior of the U.S., reflecting a shift in enforcement tactics.Most unauthorized immigrants live with spouses, partners, their children or other relatives. In 2016, 5.6 million children younger than 18 were living with unauthorized immigrant parents.5 Of these, 675,000 were unauthorized immigrants themselves, a number that has fallen by half since 2007. The other 5 million children were born in the U.S., a number that rose from 4.5 million in 2007. The number of U.S.-born children leveled off in recent years as births to unauthorized immigrants have dipped and an increasing number of children of unauthorized immigrants have aged into adulthood.By 2016, 975,000 adult U.S.-born children of unauthorized immigrants were living with their parents. This total does not include U.S.-born children of unauthorized immigrants who live elsewhere.Unauthorized immigrants lived in 5.2 million U.S. households in 2016 – about one in every 23 U.S. households, not much different from 2007. About 170,000 lived in group quarters such as college dormitories, hospitals and prisons.Just as with the population overall, the number of adult unauthorized immigrants in the workforce – 7.8 million – was lower in 2016 than a decade earlier. Their share of the workforce (4.8%) also declined from 2007. The decline in the unauthorized immigrant workforce stems mainly from the decline in the overall unauthorized immigrant population.The decline in numbers came even though the labor force participation rate of unauthorized immigrants rose slightly from 2007 to 2016, as it did for both lawful immigrants and U.S.-born women, but not U.S.-born men.Among occupations, unauthorized immigrants are a larger share of the workforce in low-skilled jobs such as farming (where they were about a quarter of the workforce in 2016) and construction (15%) than in higher-skilled categories.The number of unauthorized immigrant workers in these lower-skilled occupational categories generally has declined since 2007. However, the number who work in management, business and professional jobs, a more skilled category, rose by a third, or 275,000 people, over the decade. Unauthorized immigrants make up only a small share of the overall workforce (2%) in this category.A dozen states registered declines in their populations of unauthorized immigrants since 2007: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Oregon. Three had increases: Louisiana, Maryland and Massachusetts. In the remaining states, there may have been changes, whether up or down, but they fell within the margin of error and cannot be stated with statistical certainty.The estimates in this report, while derived from U.S. Census Bureau data, differ from published statistics because we augment and adjust the data; see Methodology for details. All estimates in this report supersede previously published estimates.When it comes to public opinion about unauthorized immigrants, most Americans say they feel sympathy toward them personally. Most also continue to say that unauthorized immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens do not want, and that they are not more likely than U.S. citizens to commit serious crimes. There are partisan differences on these questions, with Republicans more divided in their views of unauthorized immigrants and Democrats more favorable toward them.A partisan gap was also evident when U.S. registered voters were asked before the recent midterm elections how serious a problem illegal immigration was for the nation. Given a list of 18 issues, Republican registered voters ranked illegal immigration the highest, and Democratic registered voters ranked it the lowest. Among Republicans, 75% said it was a very big problem, compared with 19% of Democrats.On a policy level, most Americans favor granting permanent legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children. And a 56% majority opposes substantially expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. However, there are party differences on both issues. Democrats (89%) are more likely than Republicans (54%) to favor legal status for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Republicans widely favor expanding the border wall, while Democrats widely oppose that proposal.Asked whether the nation’s policy priority should be “creating a way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens if they meet certain requirements” or “better border security and stronger enforcement of our immigration laws” or whether both should be given equal priority, a plurality of registered voters (47%) say both. This is true for nearly half of Republicans (48%) and Democrats (45%) alike. Still, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to prefer an enforcement strategy, and Democrats are more likely than Republicans to prioritize a path to citizenship.U.S. born refers to people who are U.S. citizens at birth, including people born in the United States, Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories, as well as those born elsewhere to at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen.Foreign born refers to people who are not a U.S. citizen at birth or who, in other words, are born outside the U.S., Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories and whose parents are not U.S. citizens. The terms “foreign born” and “immigrant” are used interchangeably. There are two immigrant categories:Labor force refers to the civilian labor force, consists of people ages 16 and older who are employed, or are unemployed and looking for work. Workforce is used interchangeably with labor force. People in the labor force are referred to as workers regardless of their employment status.Occupation and industry category titles used in the report have been shortened for display purposes; see Methodology for the full list of U.S. Census Bureau categories. The words occupation and job are used interchangeably, as are the words industry and sector.Population figures may differ from published U.S. Census Bureau totals because the data are augmented and adjusted for undercount when used as the basis for estimates.Recent arrivals refer to immigrants who have come to live in the U.S. in the previous five years.

Very recent Immigration Court records reveal that during FY 2017 asylum decisions were up sharply. A
total of 30,179 cases were decided by judges last year, a marked increase from 22,312 cases in FY 2016.
This is the largest number of asylum cases decided in any one year since FY 2005. While asylum grants
increased, denials grew even faster. This pushed the percent who were denied asylum to 61.8 percent.
This is the fifth year in a row that denial rates have risen. Five years ago the denial rate was just 44.5
percent. See Figure 1.





Figure 1. Immigration Court Asylum Decisions: All Cases
(Click for larger image)



This report is the second in a two-part series examining this recent data. 
The first report looked at how
asylum outcome increasingly depended on the judge assigned the case. This report analyzes national
trends in the number of asylum decisions, and how outcomes differ by nationality and whether asylum
seekers were represented[1]. In addition, TRAC has 
released individual reports on 
each of 293 immigration judges that compare the asylum decisions each rendered between FY 2012-FY 2017.


These latest Immigration Court numbers are based on case-by-case records obtained through a series of
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC)
at Syracuse University.

More Unrepresented Among Asylum Seekers

The proportion of asylum seekers who are unable to obtain representation has risen markedly. Ten
years ago during FY 2007, only 13.6 percent were unrepresented. Five years ago (FY 2012), 15.8 percent
were unrepresented. In FY 2017 the unrepresented figure was 20.6 percent. However, the proportion
was even higher during FY 2014 when asylum seekers without attorneys suddenly jumped to 23.2
percent. Since then the rate has slowly subsided. However, the proportion of asylum seekers who were
unrepresented last year remained significantly higher than levels prior to the 2014 jump. See Figure 2.


These figures reflect in part the inadequacy of the supply of attorneys to keep up with increases in
demand which occurred over this period[2]. Recent efforts to increase the availability of attorneys
through ramped up pro bono efforts and government-funded programs have sought to increase this
supply. However, given the court's backlog, it may take some time before these newly represented
cases are decided and the full impact of these programs will be felt.

Odds of Gaining Asylum Five Times Higher When Represented

Without representation, the deck is stacked against an asylum seeker. Statistically, only one out of
every ten win their case. With representation, nearly half are successful. Figure 3 shows trends in
asylum denial rates over the past two decades when just decisions in represented cases are examined.


The number of decisions in represented cases also increased in FY 2017. However, denials again grew
faster. This has resulted in a similar rise in denial rates over the past five years as shown earlier in Figure
1, even though only cases with representation are graphed in Figure 3. Detailed statistics for both
represented and for unrepresented cases are given in Table 1 at the end of this report.





Figure 3. Immigration Court Asylum Decisions: Cases with Representation

Asylum Seekers Success Varies Markedly by Nationality

China had the largest number of asylum seekers. During the last six years, 31,176 decisions involved
asylum seekers from China. Far behind China but in second place was El Salvador with half the number
(15,667). Mexico was close behind El Salvador in the number of asylum decisions (14,688), followed by
Honduras (11,020) and Guatemala (10,983).


There was also wide variation in asylum grant and denial rates depending upon the nationality of the
asylum seeker. Focusing first on just the ten nationalities that had the largest number of Immigration
Court asylum cases decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Mexico had the highest denial rate with almost
nine out of ten (88.0%) turned down. See Figure 4. The three Central American countries that each
have had large numbers arriving at U.S. borders seeking asylum also had very high denial rates: El
Salvador (79.2%), Honduras (78.1%), and Guatemala (74.7%).


Asylum seekers from Ethiopia were the most successful among the top ten nationalities with
denial rates of only 17.0 percent. China was in second place with its 20.3 percent denial rate,
followed by Nepal with just one quarter denied (25.1%).





Figure 4. Asylum Denial Rates by Nationality, FY 2012 - FY 2017
(Click for larger image)



Expanding the comparisons to all countries that had at least 25 asylum seekers with cases
decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Jamaica had the highest denial rate (91.4%), followed
closely by Laos (89.9%), the Philippines, (89.7%) and Mexico (88.0%).


At the other extreme, the Soviet Union had the lowest denial rate (9.5%), with Byelorussia and
Egypt with almost as low denial rates at 11.1 percent each.

Outcomes by Nationality and Representation Status

Regardless of nationality, representation status still made a big difference between whether
asylum was granted or denied. Focusing again on just the ten countries with the largest number
of cases decided, Figure 5 contrasts the denial rates for asylum decisions in which the asylum
seekers did or didn't have an attorney to represent them. While having an attorney did not
guarantee success, denial rates for those without an attorney were uniformly high. Indeed, for
the majority of countries nationality had little impact for the unrepresented.


Unrepresented asylum seekers from three countries shown in Figure 4 — Somalia, China, and
Ethiopia — had lower rates of denial than might otherwise be expected, and distinctly lower than
those that were unrepresented from the other seven countries. An asylum seeker is counted as
unrepresented in the court's data if an attorney hasn't formally entered an appearance in the case.
While data are unavailable on other forms of assistance, it is possible that asylum seekers from
different countries may also differ in their access to informal networks that provide helpful
advice even when they aren't officially represented.

[1]
These cover asylum decisions decided by immigration judges. While there are a large number of cases involving
unaccompanied children before immigration judges, the actual decisions on whether to grant asylum or other relief
is often decided by other parties. Where this happens, such asylum decisions are not part of the data examined
here.



[2]
Even though these figures do not include many cases involving unaccompanied children since decisions to provide
relief are usually rendered by other bodies [see note above], evidence shows that the surging number of such
children along with mothers with children seeking refuge in this country exceeded the availability of attorneys
willing and able to take their cases. See, for 
example, November 2014 TRAC report.

(click title to open in a new window)

This report is the second in a two-part series examining this recent data. 
The first report looked at how
asylum outcome increasingly depended on the judge assigned the case. This report analyzes national
trends in the number of asylum decisions, and how outcomes differ by nationality and whether asylum
seekers were represented[1]. In addition, TRAC has 
released individual reports on 
each of 293 immigration judges that compare the asylum decisions each rendered between FY 2012-FY 2017.


These latest Immigration Court numbers are based on case-by-case records obtained through a series of
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC)
at Syracuse University.

More Unrepresented Among Asylum Seekers

The proportion of asylum seekers who are unable to obtain representation has risen markedly. Ten
years ago during FY 2007, only 13.6 percent were unrepresented. Five years ago (FY 2012), 15.8 percent
were unrepresented. In FY 2017 the unrepresented figure was 20.6 percent. However, the proportion
was even higher during FY 2014 when asylum seekers without attorneys suddenly jumped to 23.2
percent. Since then the rate has slowly subsided. However, the proportion of asylum seekers who were
unrepresented last year remained significantly higher than levels prior to the 2014 jump. See Figure 2.


These figures reflect in part the inadequacy of the supply of attorneys to keep up with increases in
demand which occurred over this period[2]. Recent efforts to increase the availability of attorneys
through ramped up pro bono efforts and government-funded programs have sought to increase this
supply. However, given the court's backlog, it may take some time before these newly represented
cases are decided and the full impact of these programs will be felt.

Odds of Gaining Asylum Five Times Higher When Represented

Without representation, the deck is stacked against an asylum seeker. Statistically, only one out of
every ten win their case. With representation, nearly half are successful. Figure 3 shows trends in
asylum denial rates over the past two decades when just decisions in represented cases are examined.


The number of decisions in represented cases also increased in FY 2017. However, denials again grew
faster. This has resulted in a similar rise in denial rates over the past five years as shown earlier in Figure
1, even though only cases with representation are graphed in Figure 3. Detailed statistics for both
represented and for unrepresented cases are given in Table 1 at the end of this report.





Figure 3. Immigration Court Asylum Decisions: Cases with Representation
(Click for larger image)


Asylum Seekers Success Varies Markedly by Nationality

China had the largest number of asylum seekers. During the last six years, 31,176 decisions involved
asylum seekers from China. Far behind China but in second place was El Salvador with half the number
(15,667). Mexico was close behind El Salvador in the number of asylum decisions (14,688), followed by
Honduras (11,020) and Guatemala (10,983).


There was also wide variation in asylum grant and denial rates depending upon the nationality of the
asylum seeker. Focusing first on just the ten nationalities that had the largest number of Immigration
Court asylum cases decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Mexico had the highest denial rate with almost
nine out of ten (88.0%) turned down. See Figure 4. The three Central American countries that each
have had large numbers arriving at U.S. borders seeking asylum also had very high denial rates: El
Salvador (79.2%), Honduras (78.1%), and Guatemala (74.7%).


Asylum seekers from Ethiopia were the most successful among the top ten nationalities with
denial rates of only 17.0 percent. China was in second place with its 20.3 percent denial rate,
followed by Nepal with just one quarter denied (25.1%).

(Click for larger image)



Expanding the comparisons to all countries that had at least 25 asylum seekers with cases
decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Jamaica had the highest denial rate (91.4%), followed
closely by Laos (89.9%), the Philippines, (89.7%) and Mexico (88.0%).


At the other extreme, the Soviet Union had the lowest denial rate (9.5%), with Byelorussia and
Egypt with almost as low denial rates at 11.1 percent each.

Outcomes by Nationality and Representation Status

Regardless of nationality, representation status still made a big difference between whether
asylum was granted or denied. Focusing again on just the ten countries with the largest number
of cases decided, Figure 5 contrasts the denial rates for asylum decisions in which the asylum
seekers did or didn't have an attorney to represent them. While having an attorney did not
guarantee success, denial rates for those without an attorney were uniformly high. Indeed, for
the majority of countries nationality had little impact for the unrepresented.


Unrepresented asylum seekers from three countries shown in Figure 4 — Somalia, China, and
Ethiopia — had lower rates of denial than might otherwise be expected, and distinctly lower than
those that were unrepresented from the other seven countries. An asylum seeker is counted as
unrepresented in the court's data if an attorney hasn't formally entered an appearance in the case.
While data are unavailable on other forms of assistance, it is possible that asylum seekers from
different countries may also differ in their access to informal networks that provide helpful
advice even when they aren't officially represented.

Footnotes



[1]
These cover asylum decisions decided by immigration judges. While there are a large number of cases involving
unaccompanied children before immigration judges, the actual decisions on whether to grant asylum or other relief
is often decided by other parties. Where this happens, such asylum decisions are not part of the data examined
here.



[2]
Even though these figures do not include many cases involving unaccompanied children since decisions to provide
relief are usually rendered by other bodies [see note above], evidence shows that the surging number of such
children along with mothers with children seeking refuge in this country exceeded the availability of attorneys
willing and able to take their cases. See, for 
example, November 2014 TRAC report.

These cover asylum decisions decided by immigration judges. While there are a large number of cases involving
unaccompanied children before immigration judges, the actual decisions on whether to grant asylum or other relief
is often decided by other parties. Where this happens, such asylum decisions are not part of the data examined
here.



[2]
Even though these figures do not include many cases involving unaccompanied children since decisions to provide
relief are usually rendered by other bodies [see note above], evidence shows that the surging number of such
children along with mothers with children seeking refuge in this country exceeded the availability of attorneys
willing and able to take their cases. See, for 
example, November 2014 TRAC report.

These figures reflect in part the inadequacy of the supply of attorneys to keep up with increases in
demand which occurred over this period[2]. Recent efforts to increase the availability of attorneys
through ramped up pro bono efforts and government-funded programs have sought to increase this
supply. However, given the court's backlog, it may take some time before these newly represented
cases are decided and the full impact of these programs will be felt.

Odds of Gaining Asylum Five Times Higher When Represented

Without representation, the deck is stacked against an asylum seeker. Statistically, only one out of
every ten win their case. With representation, nearly half are successful. Figure 3 shows trends in
asylum denial rates over the past two decades when just decisions in represented cases are examined.


The number of decisions in represented cases also increased in FY 2017. However, denials again grew
faster. This has resulted in a similar rise in denial rates over the past five years as shown earlier in Figure
1, even though only cases with representation are graphed in Figure 3. Detailed statistics for both
represented and for unrepresented cases are given in Table 1 at the end of this report.





Figure 3. Immigration Court Asylum Decisions: Cases with Representation

Asylum Seekers Success Varies Markedly by Nationality

China had the largest number of asylum seekers. During the last six years, 31,176 decisions involved
asylum seekers from China. Far behind China but in second place was El Salvador with half the number
(15,667). Mexico was close behind El Salvador in the number of asylum decisions (14,688), followed by
Honduras (11,020) and Guatemala (10,983).


There was also wide variation in asylum grant and denial rates depending upon the nationality of the
asylum seeker. Focusing first on just the ten nationalities that had the largest number of Immigration
Court asylum cases decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Mexico had the highest denial rate with almost
nine out of ten (88.0%) turned down. See Figure 4. The three Central American countries that each
have had large numbers arriving at U.S. borders seeking asylum also had very high denial rates: El
Salvador (79.2%), Honduras (78.1%), and Guatemala (74.7%).


Asylum seekers from Ethiopia were the most successful among the top ten nationalities with
denial rates of only 17.0 percent. China was in second place with its 20.3 percent denial rate,
followed by Nepal with just one quarter denied (25.1%).





Figure 4. Asylum Denial Rates by Nationality, FY 2012 - FY 2017
(Click for larger image)



Expanding the comparisons to all countries that had at least 25 asylum seekers with cases
decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Jamaica had the highest denial rate (91.4%), followed
closely by Laos (89.9%), the Philippines, (89.7%) and Mexico (88.0%).


At the other extreme, the Soviet Union had the lowest denial rate (9.5%), with Byelorussia and
Egypt with almost as low denial rates at 11.1 percent each.

Outcomes by Nationality and Representation Status

Regardless of nationality, representation status still made a big difference between whether
asylum was granted or denied. Focusing again on just the ten countries with the largest number
of cases decided, Figure 5 contrasts the denial rates for asylum decisions in which the asylum
seekers did or didn't have an attorney to represent them. While having an attorney did not
guarantee success, denial rates for those without an attorney were uniformly high. Indeed, for
the majority of countries nationality had little impact for the unrepresented.


Unrepresented asylum seekers from three countries shown in Figure 4 — Somalia, China, and
Ethiopia — had lower rates of denial than might otherwise be expected, and distinctly lower than
those that were unrepresented from the other seven countries. An asylum seeker is counted as
unrepresented in the court's data if an attorney hasn't formally entered an appearance in the case.
While data are unavailable on other forms of assistance, it is possible that asylum seekers from
different countries may also differ in their access to informal networks that provide helpful
advice even when they aren't officially represented.

Salvador (79.2%), Honduras (78.1%), and Guatemala (74.7%).


Asylum seekers from Ethiopia were the most successful among the top ten nationalities with
denial rates of only 17.0 percent. China was in second place with its 20.3 percent denial rate,
followed by Nepal with just one quarter denied (25.1%).

Expanding the comparisons to all countries that had at least 25 asylum seekers with cases
decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Jamaica had the highest denial rate (91.4%), followed
closely by Laos (89.9%), the Philippines, (89.7%) and Mexico (88.0%).


At the other extreme, the Soviet Union had the lowest denial rate (9.5%), with Byelorussia and
Egypt with almost as low denial rates at 11.1 percent each.

Outcomes by Nationality and Representation Status

Regardless of nationality, representation status still made a big difference between whether
asylum was granted or denied. Focusing again on just the ten countries with the largest number
of cases decided, Figure 5 contrasts the denial rates for asylum decisions in which the asylum
seekers did or didn't have an attorney to represent them. While having an attorney did not
guarantee success, denial rates for those without an attorney were uniformly high. Indeed, for
the majority of countries nationality had little impact for the unrepresented.


Unrepresented asylum seekers from three countries shown in Figure 4 — Somalia, China, and
Ethiopia — had lower rates of denial than might otherwise be expected, and distinctly lower than
those that were unrepresented from the other seven countries. An asylum seeker is counted as
unrepresented in the court's data if an attorney hasn't formally entered an appearance in the case.
While data are unavailable on other forms of assistance, it is possible that asylum seekers from
different countries may also differ in their access to informal networks that provide helpful
advice even when they aren't officially represented.

These cover asylum decisions decided by immigration judges. While there are a large number of cases involving
unaccompanied children before immigration judges, the actual decisions on whether to grant asylum or other relief
is often decided by other parties. Where this happens, such asylum decisions are not part of the data examined
here.



[2]
Even though these figures do not include many cases involving unaccompanied children since decisions to provide
relief are usually rendered by other bodies [see note above], evidence shows that the surging number of such
children along with mothers with children seeking refuge in this country exceeded the availability of attorneys
willing and able to take their cases. See, for 
example, November 2014 TRAC report.

China had the largest number of asylum seekers. During the last six years, 31,176 decisions involved
asylum seekers from China. Far behind China but in second place was El Salvador with half the number
(15,667). Mexico was close behind El Salvador in the number of asylum decisions (14,688), followed by
Honduras (11,020) and Guatemala (10,983).


There was also wide variation in asylum grant and denial rates depending upon the nationality of the
asylum seeker. Focusing first on just the ten nationalities that had the largest number of Immigration
Court asylum cases decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Mexico had the highest denial rate with almost
nine out of ten (88.0%) turned down. See Figure 4. The three Central American countries that each

Expanding the comparisons to all countries that had at least 25 asylum seekers with cases

Outcomes by Nationality and Representation Status

Regardless of nationality, representation status still made a big difference between whether
asylum was granted or denied. Focusing again on just the ten countries with the largest number
of cases decided, Figure 5 contrasts the denial rates for asylum decisions in which the asylum
seekers did or didn't have an attorney to represent them. While having an attorney did not
guarantee success, denial rates for those without an attorney were uniformly high. Indeed, for
the majority of countries nationality had little impact for the unrepresented.


Unrepresented asylum seekers from three countries shown in Figure 4 — Somalia, China, and
Ethiopia — had lower rates of denial than might otherwise be expected, and distinctly lower than

These cover asylum decisions decided by immigration judges. While there are a large number of cases involving
unaccompanied children before immigration judges, the actual decisions on whether to grant asylum or other relief
is often decided by other parties. Where this happens, such asylum decisions are not part of the data examined
here.

Even though these figures do not include many cases involving unaccompanied children since decisions to provide
relief are usually rendered by other bodies [see note above], evidence shows that the surging number of such
children along with mothers with children seeking refuge in this country exceeded the availability of attorneys
willing and able to take their cases. See, for

Expanding the comparisons to all countries that had at least 25 asylum seekers with cases
decided during FY 2012 - FY 2017, Jamaica had the highest denial rate (91.4%), followed
closely by Laos (89.9%), the Philippines, (89.7%) and Mexico (88.0%).


At the other extreme, the Soviet Union had the lowest denial rate (9.5%), with Byelorussia and
Egypt with almost as low denial rates at 11.1 percent each.

Outcomes by Nationality and Representation Status

Regardless of nationality, representation status still made a big difference between whether
asylum was granted or denied. Focusing again on just the ten countries with the largest number
of cases decided, Figure 5 contrasts the denial rates for asylum decisions in which the asylum
seekers did or didn't have an attorney to represent them. While having an attorney did not
guarantee success, denial rates for those without an attorney were uniformly high. Indeed, for
the majority of countries nationality had little impact for the unrepresented.


Unrepresented asylum seekers from three countries shown in Figure 4 — Somalia, China, and
Ethiopia — had lower rates of denial than might otherwise be expected, and distinctly lower than
those that were unrepresented from the other seven countries. An asylum seeker is counted as
unrepresented in the court's data if an attorney hasn't formally entered an appearance in the case.
While data are unavailable on other forms of assistance, it is possible that asylum seekers from
different countries may also differ in their access to informal networks that provide helpful
advice even when they aren't officially represented.

Table 2. Immigration Court Asylum Denial Rates by Nationality and Representation Status, FY 2012 - FY 2017

(click title to open in a new window)

Unrepresented asylum seekers from three countries shown in Figure 4 — Somalia, China, and
Ethiopia — had lower rates of denial than might otherwise be expected, and distinctly lower than
those that were unrepresented from the other seven countries. An asylum seeker is counted as
unrepresented in the court's data if an attorney hasn't formally entered an appearance in the case.
While data are unavailable on other forms of assistance, it is possible that asylum seekers from
different countries may also differ in their access to informal networks that provide helpful
advice even when they aren't officially represented.

Even though these figures do not include many cases involving unaccompanied children since decisions to provide

Q.  What are your current job responsibilities? A.  I work at a nonprofit law firm that represents people harmed by the government’s failure to regulate immigration. Besides our general courtroom advocacy work, we also have an active investigative and FOIA program that I’ve been helping to run since I started in 2015. We frequently file FOIA suits when requests are stonewalled or when records are improperly withheld. We work on FOIA with agency insiders, Hill staffers, and immigration-control activists in general.Q.  About how many requests, appeals, and lawsuits have you worked on at IRLI? A. Since we started our FOIA practice in 2015, we’ve submitted around 150 requests (mostly federal), each one containing around 5 or 6 request items.  Currently, we have about a dozen appeals pending and around 5 lawsuits, each one regarding 5 to 8 requests.Q.   What would you say are your most notable FOIA matters at IRLI?   We uncovered some highly revealing emails from 2013 between ICE agents and their D.C. superiors and between ICE agents themselves, the latter expressing frustration they were being forced to release from detention criminal aliens previously deemed a ‘public safety risk’ due to the GOP-led sequestration. The agents basically call this political theatre performed at the expense of the public’s safety.Additionally, we obtained more than one thousand pages of DHS Secretary’s calendar records and found, among other things, that he met routinely provided access to open-borders groups and lobbyists. We also pinpointed the date of a key meeting in which the President’s 2014 executive amnesty program appeared to have been hatched.Q.  What is the most unusual agency response you have received to a FOIA request?A. We’re frequently told the government “does not track the data” we’re requesting. It’s a curious response as it’s not an admission that the information isn’t held and maintained; it simply means they don’t actively track or tally it. For this reason, for data requests we always specify that the agency should pull the data regardless.Q.  What do you like and not like about working on FOIA matters? A. Being able to generate original content for and generally enlighten the news-reading public on matters the government doesn’t want them to know about can be very satisfying. But to be honest, the FOIA process is very draining for the most part. There are numerous ways the government ensures that requestors do not receive information to which they’re entitled and keeps certain information out of public view.  Being able to know the policy area closely, how the agencies work, how to appeal effectively, and what precisely to ask for does go very far, but it’s highly frustrating to know those assets and efforts shouldn’t be as necessary as they are. Q.   If you could change one thing about the statute, what would it be and why?  A. Obviously Exemption 5 has to be narrowed if FOIA is to mean anything. It’s being employed more and more amongst the agencies, apparently becoming a ‘go-to’ redaction for yes-men bureaucrats. Throughout the Obama years, a big problem for immigration-control activists has been the administration pushing through open-borders policies via agency directives that go completely against statute. Being able to ascertain the legal rationale for those directives would go a long way in putting top cabinet officials and their attorneys on notice and curbing executive overreach. Mind you, I’m not calling for transparency when it comes premature disclosure of policies under review; only for transparency of pre-decisional documents with regards to implemented decisions. A time limit on the use of Exemption 5 might be a less complicated -- though less satisfactory -- way of achieving this.Before the latest FOIA amendments, it had been discussed among frequent requestors that a public interest balancing test be employed with regards to Exemption 5. This would prevent agencies from hiding their policy deliberations, for example, when the public benefits of disclosure outweigh the risks of harm. At the very least, such a test would check the agencies blanket use of Exemption 5.FOIA officers routinely defend themselves to me by saying Congress just won’t appropriate the necessary funds i.e. for more officers, better processing systems, etc. Taking their excuses at face value, I say increase the fees then. Fees could be dramatically ramped up, for instance, for commercial requestors, such as the now-common hedge fund requestors who, of course, can and will pay fees. Also, being more forthcoming with documents and preventing litigation would free up resources and decrease the amount of litigation fees expended by agencies after they lose FOIA fights.Q.   If the government would release any document(s) you requested, what would you ask for and why?A. We sued DOJ in an attempt to obtain the legal opinion published by the Office of Legal Counsel regarding Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals amnesty announcement. Through this process, we found out that the opinion was “oral” (according to them) and never actually formally drafted. Since then, I’ve raised this curious issue in op-eds: why did DOJ subsequently opt for a more transparent and formal drafting process two years later for the identical Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program? So there’s that, and illegal alien-crime figures as well. On behalf of a client of ours, Don Rosenberg, whose son was killed by an illegal alien, we’re trying to retrieve the data needed to ascertain these figures. As Don’s mentioned in op-eds, “After all, the Justice Department can tell me how many pick-pocketing crimes there were last year but not how many people were killed by illegal aliens.”  Q.  Where were you born/grow up?A.  I was born just outside Seattle, grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia, and lived in Beijing, Hong Kong, and Sydney, Australia for many years.  Q.  Where have you attended school and what did you study?   A. I studied English Literature at the University of British Columbia and law at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.Q.  What do you like to do in your spare time? A. I write for our staff blog when I’m free -- always about immigration law and policy. I publish the posts at The Hill, National Review, Daily Caller, and several other outlets. I also read a lot.Q.  If you could meet any historical icon, of the past or present, who would it be and why?A. I don’t think I need to meet with anyone in particular, but there are certainly people who I wish were still around. I grew up reading George Orwell and he’s certainly been an important influence. His articulation on the specialness of the English alone should guarantee his place in the canon, although it really was his ability to persevere through the intellectual intimidations of his time that impresses me most. It was impossible for him to not speak his mind and point out the hypocrites, like the apologists for Stalin among the British intelligentsia. Then, of course, there are the ideas on thought-control he expressed in 1984, and the use of distortive, euphemistic language, etc. I certainly would have liked to hear what he’d have to say today, especially on the highly exploitative language from the open-borders movement.Q.  What are some of your favorite books and television shows? A. Favorite books on the topic of immigration would have to include How Many Is Too Many? by Phil Cafaro. It covers most of the policy arguments for controlling and reducing our intake numbers and in an incredibly thoughtful way. The more cloistered and naïve elements in our society today feel immigration in the West must operate like a global welfare program i.e. the West is rich, so adding to its population increases global wealth, etc. It’s a surprisingly difficult argument to take on, because it’s so impossibly naïve, however, Cafaro refutes it handedly. I haven’t watched TV since the nineties.  [9/1/18:  Please see the following update concerning our interview with Mr. Smith]

It directly contradicts claims by President Trump and members of his cabinet who say that the human contribution to climate change is uncertain, and that the ability to predict the effects is limited.“Evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans,” a draft of the report states. It was uploaded to a nonprofit internet digital library in January but received little attention until it was published by The New York Times.The authors note that thousands of studies, conducted by tens of thousands of scientists, have documented climate changes on land and in the air. “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change,” they wrote.The report was completed this year and is a special science section of the National Climate Assessment, which is congressionally mandated every four years. The National Academy of Sciences has signed off on the draft report, and the authors are awaiting permission from the Trump administration to release it.One scientist who worked on the report, Katharine Hayhoe, a professor of political science at Texas Tech University, called the conclusions among “the most comprehensive climate science reports” to be published. Another scientist involved in the process, who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity, said he and others were concerned that it would be suppressed.The White House and the Environmental Protection Agency did not immediately return calls or respond to emails requesting comment on Monday night.The report concludes that even if humans immediately stopped emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the world would still feel at least an additional 0.50 degrees Fahrenheit (0.30 degrees Celsius) of warming over this century compared with today. The projected actual rise, scientists say, will be as much as 2 degrees Celsius.A small difference in global temperatures can make a big difference in the climate: The difference between a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius and one of 2 degrees Celsius, for example, could mean longer heat waves, more intense rainstorms and the faster disintegration of coral reefs.Among the more significant of the study’s findings is that it is possible to attribute some extreme weather to climate change. The field known as “attribution science” has advanced rapidly in response to increasing risks from climate change.A draft report by scientists from 13 federal agencies concludes that Americans are feeling the effects of climate change right now.The E.P.A. is one of 13 agencies that must approve the report by Aug. 18. The agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt, has said he does not believe that carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming.“It’s a fraught situation,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geoscience and international affairs at Princeton University who was not involved in the study. “This is the first case in which an analysis of climate change of this scope has come up in the Trump administration, and scientists will be watching very carefully to see how they handle it.”Scientists say they fear that the Trump administration could change or suppress the report. But those who challenge scientific data on human-caused climate change say they are equally worried that the draft report, as well as the larger National Climate Assessment, will be publicly released.The National Climate Assessment “seems to be on autopilot” because of a lack of political direction, said Myron Ebell, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.The report says significant advances have been made linking human influence to individual extreme weather events since the last National Climate Assessment was produced in 2014. Still, it notes, crucial uncertainties remain.It cites the European heat wave of 2003 and the record heat in Australia in 2013 as specific episodes where “relatively strong evidence” showed that a man-made factor contributed to the extreme weather.In the United States, the authors write, the heat wave that broiled Texas in 2011 was more complicated. That year was Texas’ driest on record, and one study cited in the report said local weather variability and La Niña were the primary causes, with a “relatively small” warming contribution. Another study had concluded that climate change made extreme events 20 times more likely in Texas.Based on those and other conflicting studies, the federal draft concludes that there was a medium likelihood that climate change played a role in the Texas heat wave. But it avoids assessing other individual weather events for their link to climate change. Generally, the report described linking recent major droughts in the United States to human activity as “complicated,” saying that while many droughts have been long and severe, they have not been unprecedented in the earth’s hydrologic natural variation.Worldwide, the draft report finds it “extremely likely” that more than half of the global mean temperature increase since 1951 can be linked to human influence.In the United States, the report concludes with “very high” confidence that the number and severity of cool nights have decreased since the 1960s, while the frequency and severity of warm days have increased. Extreme cold waves, it says, are less common since the 1980s, while extreme heat waves are more common.Americans overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that it will harm them personally.The study examines every corner of the United States and finds that all of it was touched by climate change. The average annual temperature in the United States will continue to rise, the authors write, making recent record-setting years “relatively common” in the near future. It projects increases of 5.0 to 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 to 4.8 degrees Celsius) by the late century, depending on the level of future emissions.It says the average annual rainfall across the country has increased by about 4 percent since the beginning of the 20th century. Parts of the West, Southwest and Southeast are drying up, while the Southern Plains and the Midwest are getting wetter.With a medium degree of confidence, the authors linked the contribution of human-caused warming to rising temperatures over the Western and Northern United States. It found no direct link in the Southeast.Additionally, the government scientists wrote that surface, air and ground temperatures in Alaska and the Arctic are rising at a frighteningly fast rate — twice as fast as the global average.“It is very likely that the accelerated rate of Arctic warming will have a significant consequence for the United States due to accelerating land and sea ice melting that is driving changes in the ocean including sea level rise threatening our coastal communities,” the report says.Human activity, the report goes on to say, is a primary culprit.The study does not make policy recommendations, but it notes that stabilizing the global mean temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius — what scientists have referred to as the guardrail beyond which changes become catastrophic — will require significant reductions in global levels of carbon dioxide.Nearly 200 nations agreed as part of the Paris accords to limit or cut fossil fuel emissions. If countries make good on those promises, the federal report says, that will be a key step toward keeping global warming at manageable levels.Mr. Trump announced this year that the United States would withdraw from the Paris agreement, saying the deal was bad for America.An article on Tuesday about a sweeping federal climate change report referred incorrectly to the availability of the report. While it was not widely publicized, the report was uploaded by the nonprofit Internet Archive in January; it was not first made public by The New York Times.An article last Tuesday about a sweeping federal climate change report misstated the professional credentials of Katharine Hayhoe, who contributed to the report.

2000 Donald Trump told Fortune magazine, “It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.”
During this primary season, Donald Trump made a point of not taking outside
donations, but now he is. Some of Trump’s campaign money is making its way back to the candidate himself, because unlike any other
candidate in modern history, Trump is using his businesses for his campaign.Legally, Trump has
to pay no more than fair market value, so we crunched the numbers to see how
much he’s essentially paying himself, reports CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman. 
Donald Trump has contributed more than $52 million to his presidential
campaign. “I didn’t need to do this folks. I’m spending a lot of money,” Trump said during a rally in Ohio.But the Republican nominee has offset some of that by pouring $7.2 million
dollars -- just over eight percent of the money his campaign has spent
through July --  into his own businesses.
Since Trump moved into
the general election phase, that spending has increased. 
During the first year of his campaign, he spent on average half a million dollars
a month at his own companies. But as his campaign ramped up from the end of
June through July, he spent $1.2 million at Trump businesses. “There’s a good chance that Donald Trump’s the first candidate
for president who makes money off the whole endeavor,” said Charlie Spies, a
Republican election lawyer who was Mitt Romney’s CFO in 2008. “The difference
with the Romney campaign -- he’s a numbers guy, that he’s very cheap, I think in
terms of how money is spent, so we were looking to save as much money as
possible.”Take the candidates’ travel expenses. Campaigns typically split
about the cost of flying with the press corps who fly on their planes -- a practice
Clinton started this week. On Monday, Trump allowed a small group of reporters
onto his plane. It’s unclear if they were charged, but he told them it wouldn’t
be a regular occurrence.  
Throughout the campaign, he’s paid his own aviation company $5.6 million to
fly his multiple planes like his luxury 757.He also spent more than $423,000 to rent out his private
Mar-a-Lago club. And in July, Trump’s campaign paid $48,239 to rent the Trump
National Golf Club in Westchester County. By comparison, holding an event for
thousands of people at the nearby Westchester County Center costs about
$10,000.
On rent, the campaign
has spent over $830,000 for office space at Trump Tower. In July, it
paid over $169,000, up 133 percent from May. Trump officials reportedly said they expanded into more office space in anticipation of additional staff.
“So as much as it looks
like he is putting money into the campaign, he is filling space in his building
that otherwise, there would be no revenue off of, so it absolutely is circular,”
Spies said. Spies said
what Trump is doing is not illegal, but it’s discouraging big-dollar Republican donors from giving money to their nominee.
“When they see things
like buying Trump brand products and flying on the Trump plane, it doesn’t
inspire them to give,” Spies said. The
spending on Trump brands is still well below what the Republican nominee has
personally invested in his campaign, but it also comes with free publicity that
can’t necessarily be valued.The campaign did not respond in time for our story but provided this statement to CBS News after the story aired: “Mr. Trump continues to contribute his own money to the campaign, including $2 million dollars on this report which more than accounts for things like rent at his own properties, which he is required to pay according to FEC laws. To date he has contributed over $60 million dollars to fund his campaign and to say he has profited in any way is totally and completely false,” campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks said. Watch CBS News anytime, anywhere with the our 24/7 digital news network.

Giuliani, facing a flood of questions about whether his business dealings should disqualify him from being named President-elect Donald J. Trump’s secretary of state, on Tuesday defended his lucrative 15 years in the private sector as a credential for the job.“I have friends all over the world,” Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, said in an interview. “This is not a new thing for me. When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world.”As secretary of state, Mr. Giuliani, a loyal, often ferocious backer of Mr. Trump’s candidacy, would make fighting Islamist terrorism the centerpiece of the incoming administration’s foreign policy. He vaulted to national prominence because of his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and he still views foreign policy through the prism of that day.But Mr. Giuliani’s business ties are a major red flag. He built a lucrative consulting and speechmaking career after leaving City Hall. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar and the Canadian company that is building the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and Mr. Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations.In one year — 2006 — Mr. Giuliani reported in a financial disclosure report that he had made 124 speeches, for as much as $200,000 each, and had earned a total of $11.4 million. He often made extravagant demands in return for agreeing to make a speech, including that the private plane that flew him to the engagement be a certain size.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for her speeches to Goldman Sachs, as well as for contributions Qatar made to the Clinton Foundation, which he claimed betrayed her commitment to women’s and gay rights because of Qatar’s poor record on both.This week, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned Mr. Giuliani’s fitness for the job, pointing to his list of paid speeches, his work for foreign governments and his support for the Iraq war. Mr. Trump has long claimed erroneously that he opposed the war.“It is worrisome, some of the ties to foreign governments, because that was a big complaint about many of us with Hillary Clinton and her ties and the money she received from foreign governments,” Mr. Paul told CNN on Tuesday.A list of appointees and nominees for top posts in the new administration.Mr. Giuliani defended his firm’s work for Qatar — which he said included training the Qatari police and analyzing the security of a desalinization plant — because, he said, it was done under the previous emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who abdicated in 2013. Mr. Giuliani said he had consulted the State Department about the contracts and had been told that Sheikh Khalifa was friendly toward the United States.Mr. Giuliani said he was one of dozens of prominent Americans who worked for the Iranian opposition group known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, or the M.E.K. — drawing payments at the same time it was on a State Department list designating it a terrorist organization. He sought to persuade the State Department to revoke its terrorist listing, which the Americans did in September 2012.“My ties to them are very open,” Mr. Giuliani said. “We worked very hard to get them delisted — by Hillary Clinton, by the way.”Another Giuliani client, the energy company TransCanada, applied to build the Keystone XL pipeline in the United States, and was rejected last year by President Obama after a recommendation by Secretary of State John Kerry. If it decided to apply again for permission and Mr. Giuliani ended up at the State Department, the application would land on his desk.Mr. Giuliani did not address that issue directly in the interview, saying only that his firm had offered security advice to TransCanada, when it had a partnership to build a natural-gas facility on Long Island Sound. The proposal was turned down.“I’ve done no work on the pipeline,” he said.His other clients have included a long list of prominent American corporations, including Bear Stearns, Uber and CB Richard Ellis, the real estate giant. Under contract with Purdue Pharma, the maker of the often-abused painkiller OxyContin, Mr. Giuliani used his clout with the Justice Department to press the federal authorities to offer a less onerous punishment to the company after allegations that security problems at its warehouses might have contributed to black market sales.But it is the lesser-known names that may draw the most scrutiny.TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a company that aims to “assist Western clients in furthering their business interests in the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union,” according to its website, is among the more obscure clients.Records show Mr. Giuliani has had ties dating to at least 2004 to TriGlobal, a company that has provided image consulting to Russian oligarchs and clients with deep Kremlin ties. They have included Transneft, Russia’s state-owned oil pipeline giant, which is the target of Western sanctions imposed after President Vladimir V. Putin annexed Crimea and began meddling in Ukraine.TriGlobal’s advisory board includes Ara Abramyan, listed on the company’s website as a “very close Advisor to the Russian Government’s inner circle including the President and the Prime Minister.” The company’s founding partners are Andrey Drobyshev, who claims to have strong relations with regional and municipal governments in Russia, and Vitaly Pruss, whose website profile says that he has focused on “international image development and PR for Russian & Ukrainian companies” and that from 2008 to 2011, he worked “closely with Giuliani Partners LLC.”Jeffrey Berman, one of TriGlobal’s managing partners, is also vice president of Berman Enterprises, a family-run company that worked with Giuliani Partners in 2008 to form a commercial and residential real estate investment vehicle called the Berman Opportunity Fund. Its purpose was to target foreign investors looking to take advantage of the weak dollar through real estate investments in New York and Washington.Some of the parts of the government that Mr. Trump promised to dismantle if he was elected.Few public details are available about Mr. Giuliani’s role in the real estate venture, and Mr. Berman did not return a call for comment. But some of Mr. Giuliani’s work for TriGlobal, which has offices in Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine, is featured on the company’s website.In 2004, for instance, the company arranged to have Mr. Giuliani come to Moscow to meet with the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, as well as other prominent Russian politicians and business executives. That year, Mr. Giuliani visited Magnitogorsk, Russia, “for a series of meetings with Viktor Rashnikov,” a Russian billionaire who is the chairman of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works.While Mr. Trump has vowed to bring back jobs in the United States steel industry, Russia has complained about American tariffs on steel that hurt companies like Mr. Rashnikov’s. TriGlobal also arranged for Mr. Giuliani to meet with executives from the Russian steel company in the next year in New York, where they dined at the St. Regis hotel at an event attended by Bill Clinton.In 2015, also at the company’s behest, Mr. Giuliani agreed to advise the mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko, who has called for more Western support of the Ukrainian government’s efforts to combat Russian separatists.James A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said Mr. Giuliani’s consulting work over the last 15 years should disqualify him from taking the secretary of state job.“It creates an immediate conflict of interest with leaders of nations that he has worked with,” Mr. Thurber said. “People asked about Hillary Clinton and donations to Clinton Foundation. It is very different than being paid directly by foreign countries to represent them.”Mr. Giuliani, in the Tuesday interview, acknowledged that he did not view the world exactly as Mr. Trump does. He said he regarded Mr. Putin, whom Mr. Trump has praised, as “a guy who is pushing us very hard,” adding: “I think he needs to be pushed back. I wouldn’t want to put Russia in the category of enemy — yet.”“Donald Trump is not going to pick anyone who agrees with him 100 percent,” Mr. Giuliani said.He said, however, that he could not think of any disagreements with Mr. Trump’s closest foreign policy adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who shares Mr. Giuliani’s belief that Islamist militancy poses an existential threat. If General Flynn becomes Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, the Trump administration will almost certainly revive George W. Bush’s global war on terrorism.“In my case, it might have some extra emotion because of Sept. 11,” Mr. Giuliani said.In one respect, experts said, Mr. Trump would be different from Mr. Bush. While Mr. Bush thought a lack of freedom caused jihadist terrorism to spread, Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani believe the fault lies in Islam itself.“It is a sea change, and it really changes the terms of the discussion about what to do about it,” said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of “The ISIS Apocalypse.”Mark Landler and Eric Lipton reported from Washington, and Jo Becker from New York.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Washington (CNN)President-elect Donald Trump's transition team asked the government about the possibility of getting Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump, along with Jared Kushner, his right-hand man and Ivanka Trump's husband, permission to receive top security clearance, according to a transition source.Donald Trump has taken the unprecedented step of requesting his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, receive top-secret clearance to join him for his Presidential Daily Briefings, which began Tuesday.Multiple sources tell NBC News Trump received his first briefing on Tuesday and designated both Kushner and Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn as his staff-level companions for the briefings going forward.While Flynn has the necessary security clearance, Kushner does not, and it could take weeks — or even longer — for him to receive it.Related: Ivanka Trump's Company Scrambles Over '60 Minutes' Bracelet CriticismHowever, Trump tweeted early Wednesday that he was "not trying to get 'top level security clearance' for [his] children," adding: "This was a typically false news story."It’s the latest in a series of unorthodox developments in Trump’s transition process that have cast a pall over his first week as president-elect.On Tuesday, former Rep. Mike Rogers announced he was leaving the transition team, as part of what sources close to the transition process told NBC News was a "purge" of loyalists to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was demoted from leading the effort last week due in large part to grudges held by Trump and Kushner, sources say.Naming Steve Bannon, founder and chairman of controversial conservative Alt Right-leaning outlet Breitbart, as a chief strategist in his White House sparked backlash from Democrats and gave Republicans on Capitol Hill a new headache, as many dodged questions about Bannon’s controversial comments about minorities, among other things.And on Tuesday Trump also rolled out his Presidential Inaugural Committee leadership, a list that was packed with many of Trump’s biggest donors and fundraisers and as such raised further questions about his pledge to “Drain the Swamp” and rid Washington of corruption.Related: Trump Transition Shake-Up Part of 'Stalinesque Purge' of Christie LoyalistsWhile it’s unclear when Kushner would receive security clearance, the legality of such a move is murky as well, as it raises questions about whether Trump is contravening the anti-nepotism law that bars presidents from appointing family members to cabinet positions or formal government jobs.But Trump’s advisers can argue that the transition team is temporary, and thus not covered by the law. And Trump’s own children have indicated they’ll continue to advise their father in unpaid, informal roles, which may be outside the purview of the law.Analysis: Breitbart's Steve Bannon Leads the 'Alt Right' to the White HouseStill, experts note the purpose of the 1967 anti-nepotism statute is to prevent nepotistic favoritism in the wielding of federal power and benefits, so any notion of granting such an important federal power to a non-employee family member contradicts the purpose and spirit of that law, as well as standard practice.It’s unprecedented for a “child or family member” to receive security clearances, said Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer who has held that kind of security clearance and clerked for the National Security Archive.He added, "You can't hold a security clearance as an informal advisor — there is no such concept."Andrea Mitchell, NBC's chief foreign affairs correspondent, is also the host of "Andrea Mitchell Reports," an hour of political news and interviews with top newsmakers on MSNBC.Kelly O’Donnell is a White House correspondent for NBC News.© 2019 NBC UNIVERSALPresident-elect Donald Trump named Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, to head their transition team, abruptly replacing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Friday amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is off to a rocky start.Trump also took the unusual step of naming his three oldest children and his son-in-law to top posts, moves certain to create potential conflicts of interest given that his attorney said Trump would put his children in charge of his assets while he is president.The transition team is always crucial, but especially so for the first president elected without experience in either government or the military. In addition to recruiting thousands of people to staff the White House, Cabinet agencies, embassies and other key government posts, the transition team needs to make sure Trump is briefed and prepared to take responsibility for the government and for implementing his policy initiatives as soon as he is inaugurated in just 76 days."You need to have your team on the field when the clock starts," said Max Stier, who heads the Partnership for Public Service, a Washington nonprofit that focuses on good-government practices. "This is not simply about achieving the policy promises; it's also about keeping us safe. Transitions are the point of maximum vulnerability for our nation."The effort is almost always well underway before a new president is elected, given the complexity and critical nature of the job, even as candidates know the work will be in vain if they are not chosen by the voters. Legislation passed in 2010, and updated in 2015, formalized much of the process for the transition from George W. Bush to Obama after the 2008 election, considered one of the smoothest in history. Both Trump and Hillary Clinton formed transition teams months ago that began working with the White House on first steps toward a potential handoff."One of the biggest dangers is that people will underestimate the scope," said former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who ran Mitt Romney's transition team in 2012.That may have happened in Trump's case. Following Trump's meeting Thursday at the White House with the president, several Obama officials privately noted the extent to which Trump and his staff seemed unprepared to discuss basic aspects of staffing a new administration and daunted by the extent of the challenges ahead. A follow-up meeting between Trump aides and White House transition officials scheduled for Friday was canceled, a senior Obama aide said.To be sure, some of the observations made by White House officials could be colored by partisan differences or concern that Trump appears set to dismantle Obama's legacy achievements. Many had counted on a smoother transition to a Clinton administration in which top personnel would likely include former coworkers.Trump's decision to elevate Pence to run his transition team was one of several announced Friday.Pence has proved a loyal second to Trump, backing him when other establishment Republicans were critical and finding ways to explain some of his more controversial statements in public. A former member of the House, Pence also has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other top Republicans on Capitol Hill.Christie's departure came after the recent convictions of two former top aides for creating a traffic jam leading to the George Washington Bridge to punish a mayor who would not endorse him to be reelected New Jersey governor."The mission of our team will be clear: Put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington," Trump said. "Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation."Christie was retained as a vice chair of the team, along with several of Trump's most visible campaign advisors: Dr. Ben Carson, a former GOP primary rival; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich; retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn; former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.).Sessions, who may be the most hard-line member of the Senate on immigration, has long been among Trump's most influential advisors. Stephen Miller, a former top aide to Sessions, has been Trump's top policy advisor and will take a similar role in the transition team. Rick Dearborn, Sessions' chief of staff, was named as the executive director for the transition team.The team also includes Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's campaign chief who is on leave from heading the arch-conservative Breitbart News. Several prominent business people, including Peter Thiel, one of the only major figures in Silicon Valley to endorse Trump, were named, as was Pam Bondi, the Florida attorney general who solicited and accepted a $25,000 campaign donation from Trump's family foundation in 2013, four days after Bondi said her office was considering joining a New York state probe of Trump University.Rep. Devin Nunes, the Tulare Republican who leads the House Select Intelligence Committee, was also given a top spot. He could be a key bridge for Trump and the intelligence community, which has been reluctant to rally behind Trump.Trump's children and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who guided him throughout the campaign, appear to have retained their influence in an official capacity. Kushner's presence at the White House on Thursday drew notice from Obama's staff when he asked, as they toured the West Wing, how many of the individuals there would remain into the next administration. Nearly all will depart along with the president.Briefing reporters Friday about the president's trip next week to Greece, Germany and Peru, Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security advisor, repeatedly referred to the imperative of fully educating the incoming administration about the major foreign policy issues Trump will face."The main focus of the conversation [between Trump and Obama] ... was determining how to make the best use of this transition period to fully brief up the president-elect and his team," he said. "There's a great deal of complexity."Trump's spokespeople did not respond to calls and emails asking about his preparation.Passages on Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov, were copied from the site of the Center for Presidential Transition, a nonprofit that had consulted with both campaigns about the transition, Politico reported."It's in everybody's interest to have a good transition," said Martha Kumar, the director of the White House Transition Project. "We're living in a world of great vulnerability. You can't afford to not prepare well."Los Angeles Times staff writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.Twitter: @noahbierman, @mikememoli and @cparsonsALSO:Why did Trump win?

A 1967 statute bars all public officials from hiring or promoting their relatives. While Ivanka Trump told “60 Minutes” that she is “going to be a daughter” once her father moves into the White House, the promotional email suggests her businesses are leveraging her public platform as the daughter of the President-elect to earn money.This has happened before. The day after Trump delivered a speech at the Republican National Convention, she shared a link on Twitter for supporters to purchase the $138 sheath dress from her fashion line that she wore on stage.The Trump campaign also funneled money back into Trump businesses during the election, paying his family businesses over $8.2 million, according to a Politico analysis of the campaign’s finance filings.By John CassidyJune 2, 2016If anyone still has any doubt about the troubling nature of Donald Trump’s record, he or she should be obliged to read the affidavit of Ronald Schnackenberg, a former salesman for Trump University.Following the release, earlier this week, of testimony filed in a federal lawsuit against Trump University, the United States is facing a high-stakes social-science experiment. Will one of the world’s leading democracies elect as its President a businessman who founded and operated a for-profit learning annex that some of its own employees regarded as a giant ripoff, and that the highest legal officer in New York State has described as a classic bait-and-switch scheme?If anyone still has any doubt about the troubling nature of Donald Trump’s record, he or she should be obliged to read the affidavit of Ronald Schnackenberg, a former salesman for Trump University. Schnackenberg’s testimony was one of the documents unsealed by a judge in the class-action suit, which was brought in California by some of Trump University’s disgruntled former attendees.Schnackenberg, who worked in Trump’s office at 40 Wall Street, testified that “while Trump University claimed it wanted to help consumers make money in real estate, in fact Trump University was only interested in selling every person the most expensive seminars they possibly could.” The affidavit concludes, “Based upon my personal experience and employment, I believe that Trump University was a fraudulent scheme, and that it preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money.”In one sense, the latest revelations don’t break much new ground. Back in 2013, when the office of Eric Schneiderman, New York’s Attorney General, filed a civil lawsuit against Trump and some of his associates, the complaint, which is also worth reading in full, made perfectly clear what sort of organization it was targeting. Despite Trump University’s claim that it offered “graduate programs, post graduate programs, doctorate programs,” it wasn’t a university at all. It was a company that purported to be selling Trump’s secret insights into how to make money in real estate. From the time Trump University began operating, in 2005, the A.G.’s office repeatedly warned the company that it was breaking the law by calling itself a university. (In New York State, universities have to obtain a state charter.)That was the bait—or, rather, the initial bait. According to the Attorney General’s complaint, the free classes were merely a marketing device. There, Trump University’s instructors “engaged in a methodical, Systematic Series of misrepresentations” designed to convince students to sign up for a three-day seminar, where they would learn Trump’s personal techniques and strategies for investing, at a cost of about fifteen hundred dollars.When it began, Trump University offered online classes, but it quickly switched its focus to live classes and seminars, the first of which was free to attend. One of the company’s ads said of Trump, “He’s the most celebrated entrepreneur on earth. . . . And now he’s ready to share—with Americans like you—the Trump process for investing in today’s once-in-a-lifetime real estate market.” The ad said that Trump had “hand-picked” Trump University’s instructors, and it ended with a quote from him: “I can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor, including you.”In fact, Trump hadn’t handpicked the instructors, and he didn’t attend the three-day seminars. Moreover, the complaint said, “no specific Donald Trump techniques or strategies were taught during the seminars, Donald Trump ‘never’ reviewed any of Trump University’s curricula or programming materials, nor did he review any of the content for the free seminars or the three day seminars.” So what were the attendees taught? According to the complaint, “the contents and material presented by Trump University were developed in large part by a third-party company that creates and develops materials for an array of motivational speakers and Seminar and timeshare rental companies.” The closest that the attendees at the seminars got to Trump was when they were encouraged to have their picture taken with a life-size photo of him.The alleged scam didn’t stop there. Trump University instructors told people who attended the three-day seminars that this wasn’t enough time to learn how to succeed, and encouraged them to purchase additional “mentorship” programs, which cost up to thirty-five thousand dollars. The complaint explained,This bait and switch was laid out in the Trump University Playbook (“Playbook”), which provided step-to-step directions to Trump University instructors on what to tell students during the seminars. . . . Trump University instructors and staff were given detailed guidance as to how to build rapport and approach consumers one-on-one to encourage further purchases. Trump University representatives were explicitly instructed to push the highest priced Elite programs. Even when students hesitated to purchase the expensive programs, Trump representatives were provided stock responses to encourage purchases, including encouraging students to go into debt to pay for the Elite programs.The newly released documents, which included actual Trump University playbooks (one was also uncovered by Politico earlier this year), provide more detail about the sales tactics that its employees used. Some of these methods, such as encouraging customers to max out their credit cards and playing psychological tricks on them, are familiar from the world of time-shares and other dodgy industries. “If they can afford the gold elite don’t allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite,” one of the playbooks advised the sales staff. At another point, the manual said, “Don’t ask people what they THINK about something you’ve said. Instead, always ask them how they FEEL about it. People buy emotionally and justify it logically.”One of Schnackenberg’s contributions, in his testimony, was to illustrate how these tactics worked with individuals. Recounting his experience with one couple, which included a man who was on disability, he said, “After the hard-sell sales presentation, they were considering purchasing the $35,000 Elite program. I did not feel it was an appropriate program for them because of their precarious financial condition.” Far from being commended by his bosses for his honesty, Schnackenberg said that he was reprimanded. Another salesperson then “talked them into buying the $35,000 program after I refused to sell this program to them,” he testified. “I was disgusted by this conduct and decided to resign.”Trump denies any wrongdoing. Citing surveys that he claims show that Trump University got high approval ratings from its customers, he has set up a Web site at 98percentapproval.com, which features testimonials from Trump University attendees and attacks on the Attorney General. Trump’s lawyers also told the Times that other testimony in the California case had discredited the charges made by former employees. Hope Hicks, Trump’s campaign spokesperson, said that he was looking forward to his day in court.So far, though, Trump has failed in his efforts to have the lawsuits in California and New York thrown out. And, whatever happens to the legal cases, the allegations will dog him all the way to November. On Wednesday, Hillary Clinton offered a preview of what is to come, calling Trump a “fraud” who is “trying to scam America the way he scammed all those people at Trump University.”The Clinton campaign is clearly hoping that Trump University will be to Trump as Bain Capital was to Mitt Romney—a way to portray him as just another selfish rich guy who is out to profit at the expense of ordinary folk. Commenting on Twitter, Clinton’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, wrote, “Trump U is devastating because it’s metaphor for his whole campaign: promising hardworking Americans way to get ahead, but all based on lies.”So will Trump University be the thing that brings Trump down? In a post for _The _New Republic, Brian Beutler argued that it will be “devastating” to him. On my Twitter feed, some people reacted more skeptically, pointing out that many of Trump’s supporters appear oblivious to any criticisms of him, and that Clinton isn’t necessarily the ideal prosecutor. It is also worth recalling that, in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, another populist businessman, served as Prime Minister four times despite a list of allegations against him that included bribery, tax evasion, sexual misconduct, and having ties to the mafia.One thing is clear, though. If the revelations about Trump University_ _don’t do any damage to Trump, it’s time to worry—or worry even more—about American democracy.John Cassidy has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1995.

GlasserWhen The Donald started his wealth seminars, he turned to a couple with a checkered legal past.Donald Trump needed some help in 2006. He was setting up Trump Institute, a series of seminars teaching the “way to wealth,” and was looking for expertise on how the conference business worked.He turned to a pair with a troublesome legal history to give him a hand.Mike and Irene Milin were known to law enforcement officials in a number of states for a host of get-rich-quick schemes and alleged real estate scams. They were prosecuted by the Texas attorney general for deceptive trade practices, and sued by the makers of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, to name just two of the Milins’ many legal entanglements. But Michael Sexton—then president of Trump University, which he said at the time included the Trump Institute seminars, as well as online courses—partnered with the Milins nonetheless, according to a report from The Sacramento Bee.The Milins’ oft-investigated National Grants Conferences, in effect, became the blueprint for Trump Institute. The two seminar businesses used some of the same speakers and shared office space in Boca Raton, Florida. The ads for Trump University promised to make people “millionaires,” just as the National Grants Conference commercials told customers they’d make them rich from government money. And, most importantly, Trump Institute operated itself in much the same manner as National Grants Conferences: After a promise of easy riches and a free seminar, customers were cajoled into doling out more and more money to get the key to unlocking wealth.The problem in both cases: The key never opened anything.The Milins launched National Grants Conferences in 1998, promising customers lucrative grants from the government, which they could not fulfill. Before that, the couple basically got run out of each state in which they set up a different iteration of the same shady practice. Similarly, Trump Institute promised to make people into savvy real estate investors, thanks to advice from The Donald himself. The customers never met the straw-haired impresario, however. They only got to see a cardboard cutout of his likeness.NGC went bankrupt just two years after the partnership began, after being dogged by a major complaint from 34 attorneys general across the United States. Trump University would also earn a reputation as a fraud operation and both New York State and former students have brought charges against the Republican frontrunner as a result.And he’s not shaking those charges anytime soon; Trump may have to testify in court this summer in the civil suit brought by his unhappy students, while he would otherwise be trying to consolidate his grip on the Republican nomination.The GOP frontrunner has staked his political brand on his commercial acumen. But Trump’s relationship with the Milins calls into question that business judgment, while adding to the stink surrounding Trump University.It’s unclear why Trump linked up with a pair with such a long history of legal trouble in the first place. While Trump’s current camp denies any and all involvement, the ties between the organizations are clear.NGC’s audience was the infomercial circuit, running long, flashy ads to entice new customers.Triumphant horns played over a gold backdrop as words careened in from off screen. “The secrets of how you can get government grants, loans and subsidies,” the grainy title card promised before a nearly six-minute video presented by NGC began. The Milins peered into the camera readying themselves to promise riches to the masses.It’s one of the only images available online of the couple, who in the near-decade since this was filmed have retreated into quiet seclusion in their Boca Raton home, less than 30 miles from Donald Trump’s Palm Beach palace, Mar-a-Lago.National Grants Conferences claimed that it could offer customers hundreds of billions of dollars in “free” government grants and loans. Following previous models the Milins developed, the program would provide one free seminar, after which individuals were encouraged to pay $999 for access to this information about grants, which amounted to a series of brochures and counselors who promised to help people get money.It will not shock you that the operation wasn’t exactly above board.Grants.gov lays out the criteria for getting this kind of money, which often goes to government organizations and nonprofits. It explicitly warns against “late night infomercials” promising “millions in free money.”Mike Milin began his career as a salesman in the mid-1980s for the notorious get-rich-quick scheme artist Tony Hoffman, who was famous for wearing dollar sign-shaped rings and driving a brown limousine with a license plate reading “NEGOT8R.”When Hoffman’s company “National Superstar Inc.” went bankrupt in 1986, Milin and his wife, Irene, began to run their own seminar programs, using an infomercial hosted by Robin Leach of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous to advertise their products.According to a 1987 article in the Los Angeles Times, the half-hour infomercial called “Two Years to Financial Freedom” gave the appearance that the couple was actually featured on the Leach-hosted show. In fact, Leach was merely hired for the day, along with a rented Rolls-Royce and a jet. The owners of the original program Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous later successfully sued the Milins for copying their brand, forcing the couple to alter the infomercial to keep it on the air.In the video, Milin claims that he became a banking expert after writing his master’s thesis at the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on banking and sociology. He also alleges that he turned to real estate investing as a result of being laid off as a sociology professor at the university where he taught after graduating. According to the Times article, Berkeley’s office of admissions had no record of Milin attending or teaching at the university. And Kathleen Maclay, of Berkeley’s Media Relations department, told The Daily Beast “we have no student records for a Michael Milin.”The next move for the scamming couple was a Texas-based company called Information Seminars International, for which they were also sued—this time by the Texas attorney general in 1993—who found them liable for deceptive trade practices. The Milins’ program promised that if customers paid $499 for what they referred to as the “Milin Method,” the company would turn around and help them re-sell real estate at government auctions.This was basically the same method they would use in their partnership with Trump.Then-Texas Assistant Attorney General Bruce Griffiths alleged that the couple made $30 million annually off this scheme and that when customers tried to reach anyone associated with the company by phone, no one would pick up.In a settlement that the couple signed that year, they and their partners were permanently barred from claiming that they had become wealthy from real estate. The Milins also agreed to use full names in any testimonials—though the brochures later distributed by NGC in the mid-2000s did not.In 2006, the year that Trump joined forces with the now-bankrupt company, the Milins were accused of violating Vermont’s Consumer Fraud Act by William Sorrell, the state attorney general at the time. Sorrell called National Grants Conferences “unconscionable and illegal” in public documents of the allegations reviewed by The Daily Beast. The company was ordered to pay $65,000 in legal fees and an additional nearly $325,000 to customers.Less than a year later, 34 state attorneys general wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission calling out the company for “deceptive advertising.” In 2010, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott took legal action against the company as well, resulting in them being unable to advertise as they had done so in the state.A source who previously worked with the Milins at NGC confirmed Trump’s involvement with the accused real estate scammers. And a lawyer involved in legal proceedings against the Milins also said the Trump and Milin operations were linked.The Milins loaned out some of their staffers to actually deliver seminars for Trump Institute, which have been described as live-action real estate infomercials. At the initial free seminars, attendees were allegedly encouraged to pay nearly $1,500 to go to another three-day conference, where Trump was promised to appear and give his personal advice. But if he ever came, evidence of it doesn’t appear to have been reported anywhere publicly.In two instances cited in a New York lawsuit involving Trump University—the umbrella organization for Trump Institute and other “educational” offerings—individuals said that all they received were cardboard cutouts of Trump, rather than personal visits. They were offered access to the “Gold Elite Program” for the price of $34,995, which was littered with more empty promises.It is unclear what if any direct contact Trump himself had with the Milins, but according to a 2006 report, NGC and the Trump Institute shared at least three of the same owners and a joint Boca Raton address.Yet Alan Garten, current executive vice president and general counsel for the Trump Organization, denied a number of times to The Daily Beast that Trump had any prior business with the Milins.“Neither Mr. Trump nor any of his companies ever worked with or were associated with NGC,” Garten emailed. When sent the 2006 article referencing their business deal, Garten once again said “Untrue. Never partnered or associated with NGC.” When asked a third time, he responded “simply not accurate.”But Michael Sexton, the president of Trump’s now-defunct Trump University, stated in 2006, according to The Sacramento Bee’s story, that NGC was selected to partner with them because they were “the best in the business.”The Milins themselves did not respond to multiple calls and emails from The Daily Beast.“I don’t know how to describe Mike. He was an egomaniac, not very smart, insecure guy who struck lightning in a bottle,” a source who worked at NGC, and wished not to be named, told The Daily Beast. He confirmed that NGC was using its own infrastructure—staffers and office space—to help run Trump’s fledgling education operation.Hesitant to even speak the Milins’ name aloud, the source said, “They wanted the big house and the fancy car and could give a shit.”Nolan Apostle, a 55-year-old small-business owner in San Francisco, said he learned this the hard way.“They should definitely be in jail. They should definitely pay the consequences,” Apostle told The Daily Beast about the Milins. He paid the $999 at a seminar in California in the late ’90s and didn’t receive all the materials he was promised. After half a dozen attempts to reach people affiliated with the company, Apostle didn’t get his money back.“They said, ‘We’ll get back to you.’ Of course they didn’t call,” he said.Apostle says he spoke to nearly 200 customers about their experiences with the company and not a single person got what they were promised.“I honestly—I’ve never met or spoken to anybody that actually got a grant through their system.”Ed Magedson, who runs RipoffReport.com, shared a number of emails with The Daily Beast in which customers used his services to help them get individual refunds from NGC when they didn’t get the products they were promised. His site is full of these complaints about the company.By the time that NGC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008, they owed $2.1 million to 20 of their creditors, most of which was recovered by Scott N. Schreiber, a Chicago-based lawyer.“It was a typical take the customers’ money, give them a cheap introduction class, try to get them an upsell [scheme],” Schreiber said describing NGC to The Daily Beast. He said the company provided “no value for its customers” and that the Milins had committed fraud.The couple also has an outstanding lawsuit filed in Palm Beach County court alleging the Milins defaulted on a commercial property lease. The court has not responded to an inquiry from The Daily Beast about the status of this litigation.It’s unclear when, or if, the Milins and Trump parted ways but Trump University largely ceased operations by 2011. Two years later, New York State filed a $40 million lawsuit against Trump University alleging illegal practices and false claims. A year later, a separate class-action civil suit was filed in San Diego, involving claimants from California, Florida, and New York. The lawsuits are still pending and Trump’s attorneys have expressed interest in postponing further litigation until after the presidential election. The plaintiffs are seeking to go to trial over the summer.After their business crashed and burned, the Milins later got politically involved, hosting a fundraiser for Mitt Romney in Boca Raton, shortly after his disastrous “47 percent” comment. They have contributed considerable amounts of money to political candidates, but surprisingly none to Donald Trump this cycle. Marco Rubio, however, received a $1,500 check from Irene Milin as recently as Feb. 29, according to Federal Election Commission filings.Why Trump, who at the time had an internationally recognized real estate brand and a reality television show, would allegedly team up with a ubiquitously known snake oil salesman is anyone’s guess. But for a former associate of the Milins, the answer was simple.“It was all about the money. Like all the other deals.”AdvertisementSupported byBy Russ Buettner and Charles V. BagliATLANTIC CITY — The Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel is now closed, its windows clouded over by sea salt. Only a faint outline of the gold letters spelling out T-R-U-M-P remains visible on the exterior of what was once this city’s premier casino.Not far away, the long-failing Trump Marina Hotel Casino was sold at a major loss five years ago and is now known as the Golden Nugget.At the nearly deserted eastern end of the boardwalk, the Trump Taj Mahal, now under new ownership, is all that remains of the casino empire Donald J. Trump assembled here more than a quarter-century ago. Years of neglect show: The carpets are frayed and dust-coated chandeliers dangle above the few customers there to play the penny slot machines.On the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, often boasts of his success in Atlantic City, of how he outwitted the Wall Street firms that financed his casinos and rode the value of his name to riches. A central argument of his candidacy is that he would bring the same business prowess to the Oval Office, doing for America what he did for his companies.“Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me,” Mr. Trump said in an interview in May, summing up his 25-year history here. “The money I took out of there was incredible.”[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]His audacious personality and opulent properties brought attention — and countless players — to Atlantic City as it sought to overtake Las Vegas as the country’s gambling capital. But a close examination of regulatory reviews, court records and security filings by The New York Times leaves little doubt that Mr. Trump’s casino business was a protracted failure. Though he now says his casinos were overtaken by the same tidal wave that eventually slammed this seaside city’s gambling industry, in reality he was failing in Atlantic City long before Atlantic City itself was failing.But even as his companies did poorly, Mr. Trump did well. He put up little of his own money, shifted personal debts to the casinos and collected millions of dollars in salary, bonuses and other payments. The burden of his failures fell on investors and others who had bet on his business acumen.In three interviews with The Times since late April, Mr. Trump acknowledged in general terms that high debt and lagging revenues had plagued his casinos. He did not recall details about some issues, but did not question The Times’s findings. He repeatedly emphasized that what really mattered about his time in Atlantic City was that he had made a lot of money there.Mr. Trump assembled his casino empire by borrowing money at such high interest rates — after telling regulators he would not — that the businesses had almost no chance to succeed.His casino companies made four trips to bankruptcy court, each time persuading bondholders to accept less money rather than be wiped out. But the companies repeatedly added more expensive debt and returned to the court for protection from lenders.After narrowly escaping financial ruin in the early 1990s by delaying payments on his debts, Mr. Trump avoided a second potential crisis by taking his casinos public and shifting the risk to stockholders.And he never was able to draw in enough gamblers to support all of the borrowing. During a decade when other casinos here thrived, Mr. Trump’s lagged, posting huge losses year after year. Stock and bondholders lost more than $1.5 billion.All the while, Mr. Trump received copious amounts for himself, with the help of a compliant board. In one instance, The Times found, Mr. Trump pulled more than $1 million from his failing public company, describing the transaction in securities filings in ways that may have been illegal, according to legal experts.Mr. Trump now says that he left Atlantic City at the perfect time. The record, however, shows that he struggled to hang on to his casinos years after the city had peaked, and failed only because his investors no longer wanted him in a management role.There are those here who fondly remember Mr. Trump’s showmanship, the thousands he employed in a struggling city, and the tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue his casinos generated.“He was a great person for the company,” said Scott C. Butera, the president of Mr. Trump’s company at the time of its 2004 bankruptcy. “With his oversight, his brand and marketing, he’s really adept.”Many others were glad to see him go.“He put a number of local contractors and suppliers out of business when he didn’t pay them,” said Steven P. Perskie, who was New Jersey’s top casino regulator in the early 1990s. “So when he left Atlantic City, it wasn’t, ‘Sorry to see you go.’ It was, ‘How fast can you get the hell out of here?’”Donald Trump darted beneath the 70 gold-tipped minarets and nine carved elephants that lined the roof, through the lobby and across the casino floor, seemingly oblivious to the spectators’ cries of “Donald, Donald,” and the gamblers clutching bricks of $100 bills at the blackjack tables.It was April 1990, and Mr. Trump was officially opening his third gambling resort in Atlantic City, the biggest project of his career: the $1 billion Trump Taj Mahal.“It’s truly going to be an incredible place,” he told reporters. “We’re calling it the eighth wonder of the world.”The Taj was certainly of outsize proportions: Its 42-story tower was New Jersey’s tallest building, and the casino was the world’s largest.In a remarkably short time, Mr. Trump had become a commanding figure in Atlantic City, with his casinos accounting for nearly a third of its gambling revenues and employing more than 8,000 people.Trump Plaza came first. In the early 1980s, Mr. Trump gained control of a prime spot on the boardwalk. Unable to get financing to build a casino, he forged a partnership with Harrah’s Entertainment, a national gambling operator.Harrah’s agreed to provide Mr. Trump, who did not put any additional money into the deal, with $220 million in financing to build the project, to pay him a $24 million construction management fee and to give him half the profits.The 39-story Harrah’s at Trump Plaza opened in 1984.From the start, the partners were at odds over its marketing and whose name should be paramount.“It wasn’t a well-designed partnership,” said Philip G. Satre, the retired chairman of Harrah’s. “We were a big company with an institutional approach to running a business, and he was a real estate entrepreneur who kind of shot from the hip.”Then Mr. Trump bought Hilton’s nearly completed casino in the marina district for $320 million, calling it Trump Castle. His company issued $352 million in bonds to finish construction and open the casino, and tacked on an additional $32 million. That casino opened in 1985 and competed directly against his partner’s first casino, Harrah’s Marina.The following year, Harrah’s scuttled its partnership with Mr. Trump and sold him its stake in Trump Plaza for more than $220 million.Next Mr. Trump went after the biggest casino of all, the Taj Mahal, which Resorts International, builder of Atlantic City’s first casino, was erecting. After buying a controlling interest in Resorts from the estate of its founder, Mr. Trump battled the talk show host Merv Griffin for control of the company.In the end, Mr. Griffin got the company, while Mr. Trump won the still-unfinished Taj Mahal.Even before the Taj opened, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission was concerned about the casino’s viability given its rapidly escalating costs and considered revoking its operating license. Regulators closely monitored the financial performance of the Trump casinos and the developer’s empire.Mr. Trump told the commission in 1988 that he could rein in expenses, because conventional lenders were lining up to give him money at low interest rates. He said he abhorred junk bonds, which were then popular, because they carried a bigger risk of default and thus came with higher interest rates.Within months, he reversed course, issuing $675 million worth of junk bonds, with a 14 percent interest rate, to finish construction and get the Taj open. In recent interviews, Mr. Trump has said that with each financing he routinely took money out of the casinos to invest in Manhattan real estate. Total debt on the Taj exceeded $820 million.Less than two weeks before the casino opened, Marvin B. Roffman, a casino analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, an investment firm based in Philadelphia, told The Wall Street Journal that the Taj would need to reap $1.3 million a day just to make its interest payments, a sum no casino had ever achieved.“The market just isn’t there,” Mr. Roffman told The Journal.Mr. Trump retaliated, demanding that Janney Montgomery Scott fire Mr. Roffman. It did.“It was doomed way before the start,” said W. Bucky Howard, who was promoted by Mr. Trump to president of the Taj five days after it opened, in a recent interview. “I told him it was going to fail. The Taj was underfunded.”Almost immediately, Mr. Trump had trouble making the debt payments on the Taj and his other casinos. It was also clear that the Taj was cannibalizing the Castle and the Plaza, whose combined gambling revenues dropped by $58 million the year it opened.After more than tripling as new casinos opened through the 1980s, gambling revenues in Atlantic City flattened in 1990, rising by just 1.35 percent, as gamblers grew more cautious in light of a national recession. All were hurt, recalled Mr. Perskie, the casino regulator, but none were in the catastrophic financial shape of Mr. Trump’s.At the same time, Mr. Trump’s real estate empire in Manhattan, where the recession cut property values, was also failing.In an August 1990 report, New Jersey regulators noted the “sheer volume of debt” on Mr. Trump’s holdings: $3.4 billion, including $1.3 billion on the casinos and $832.5 million in loans personally guaranteed by Mr. Trump. Regulators warned then that “the possibility of a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question.”The Taj Mahal missed its November debt payment. The Castle was also late.By December 1990, when Mr. Trump needed to make an $18.4 million interest payment, his father, Fred C. Trump, sent a lawyer to the Castle to buy $3.3 million in chips, to provide him with an infusion of cash. The younger Mr. Trump made the payment, but the Casino Control Commission fined the Castle $65,000 for what had amounted to an illegal loan.As all of his ventures neared collapse, Mr. Trump’s lenders insisted that he submit a business plan, appoint a chief financial officer for the Trump Organization and sell, among other things, the Trump Shuttle airline, his yacht and his stake in New York City’s Plaza Hotel, which also filed for bankruptcy protection. They also put him on a $450,000-a-month budget for personal and household expenses.Just over a year after it opened, the Taj Mahal was in bankruptcy court, followed in 1992 by both the Plaza and the Castle. In the plan that was worked out, Mr. Trump ceded to the lenders a 50 percent stake in the businesses in return for lower interest rates. The lenders agreed to defer certain principal and interest payments and hold off on personal claims against Mr. Trump for five years. But there was little or no reduction in the enormous debts that would plague his gambling empire far into the future.Mr. Trump now says he looks back on the period as his golden era in the casino business.“Early on, I took a lot of money out of the casinos with the financings and the things we do,” he said in a recent interview. “Atlantic City was a very good cash cow for me for a long time.”Others were hurt.“He helped expand Atlantic City, but he just did not put the equity into the projects he should have to keep them solvent,” said H. Steven Norton, a casino consultant and a former casino executive at Resorts International. “When he went bankrupt, he not only cost bondholders money, but he hurt a lot of small businesses that helped him construct the Taj Mahal.”Beth Rosser of West Chester, Pa., is still bitter over what happened to her father, whose company Triad Building Specialties nearly collapsed when Mr. Trump took the Taj into bankruptcy. It took three years to recover any money owed for his work on the casino, she said, and her father received only 30 cents on the dollar.“Trump crawled his way to the top on the back of little guys, one of them being my father,” said Ms. Rosser, who runs Triad today. “He had no regard for thousands of men and women who worked on those projects. He says he’ll make America great again, but his past shows the complete opposite of that.” Donald Trump has said that his brushes with financial disaster in the early 1990s reminded him of a lesson his father had taught him: Do not leave yourself on the hook for loans.“My father knew, like I knew, you don’t personally guarantee,” Mr. Trump is quoted saying in “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,” by Timothy L. O’Brien, a former reporter for The Times. “I’ve told people I didn’t follow my own advice.”His agreements with lenders and the two casino bankruptcies in those years still left Mr. Trump personally responsible for more than $100 million in debt, and his agreements had only delayed the day of reckoning to June 30, 1995.He dealt with that danger by first shifting much of his personal debt onto his casinos, then onto a new group: shareholders.Step 1 came in 1993, when his company sold more junk bonds, adding another $100 million in debt to the Trump Plaza casino. More than half of the new money went to pay off Mr. Trump’s unrelated personal loans.Then, in June 1995, with the risk of being forced into bankruptcy just weeks away, Mr. Trump shifted ownership of the Plaza casino to a new, publicly traded company: Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts. In the initial public offering, 10 million shares were sold at $14. At the same time, the company also sold another $155 million in junk bonds, at a 15.5 percent interest rate.Becoming a public company burdened Mr. Trump with the responsibility of putting shareholders’ interests first. But Mr. Trump, the largest shareholder and chairman of the board, could generally meet that obligation by obtaining approval from his board of directors and disclosing financial details in securities filings. The board’s three outside members were widely seen as bowing to his wishes.A week after the initial public offering, the new company began using some of the almost $300 million it had raised to clear Mr. Trump’s personal debts. During his financial pinch two years earlier, Chemical Bank had forced Mr. Trump to give up his ownership of the Trump Regency, a hotel next to the Trump Plaza. He held an option to buy it back for $60 million, which included debt on the hotel and $35.9 million that he personally owed the bank from his purchase of a Manhattan property. The new company exercised that option, in effect transferring Mr. Trump’s debt to its own balance sheet.In 1996, the public company issued more stock and sold $1.1 billion in junk bonds. The money was used in part to pay off $330 million in bonds on the Plaza that had been guaranteed by a company Mr. Trump controlled, as well as almost $30 million that Mr. Trump personally owed to two banks. The company also bought the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Castle — soon renamed the Trump Marina — shifting more of Mr. Trump’s debt to shareholders.Mr. Trump celebrated his 50th birthday that June at the Taj Mahal, with the Beach Boys onstage. A flurry of news articles said he was “back”; some even quoted Mr. Roffman, the analyst whom Mr. Trump had gotten fired, giving Mr. Trump credit for turning things around. (Mr. Roffman had won a $750,000 arbitration award from Janney Montgomery for his dismissal and settled a lawsuit against Mr. Trump for an undisclosed sum.)But some analysts — and the stock market — saw the $525 million that the public company had paid for the Castle as too much. The stock began a long slide, falling from about $35 a share before the sale, to $12 months later. Shareholders sued, alleging that the Castle’s purchase price, which included roughly $175 million in cash to Mr. Trump’s private holding company, had been a “gross and unjustified” sweetheart deal for Mr. Trump. (He later settled the suit.)Another crucial deadline came in 1998. Mr. Trump personally owed $13.5 million to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the investment bank that had underwritten the initial public offering in 1995; under the terms of that loan, he was in danger of defaulting, because the stock price of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts had fallen so low. A default would have made him lose control of the company. Instead, the casino company lent him the money to pay back the bankers. A shareholder sued, accusing the board of directors of breaching its fiduciary responsibility.“T.H.C.R. is a casino and entertainment company,” the lawsuit, filed in 1999, said. “It is not in the business of loaning money. The company desperately needed (and needs) cash to shore up its deteriorating financial condition.” (The suit was dropped in 2000, shortly after Mr. Trump paid the company back.)Indeed, the company posted losses of $66 million in 1996, $42 million in 1997 and $40 million in 1998. Those losses would continue.Still, Mr. Trump made money, receiving $1 million a year for what was essentially a part-time job. In 1996, he was paid a $5 million bonus. The public company lent him $3 million to cover costs he had incurred while exploring whether to open a casino in Indiana, then forgave the loan when the stock met price targets.The casino company leased office space in Trump Tower in Manhattan, and Mr. Trump’s other businesses were paid to entertain its “high-end customers.” It was later alleged in a lawsuit that at least part of the money was paid for big-name performers, including Celine Dion, Tony Bennett and Billy Joel, who had appeared at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Fla. In its response, Mr. Trump’s company did not challenge that allegation.Trump casinos reported paying about $300,000 a year in “pilot costs” to transport high rollers in Mr. Trump’s jet. The company never disclosed in securities filings just how much the jet was used for casino purposes.The public company’s collapse began in 1999. Just three years after spending about $60 million to buy back the former Trump Regency Hotel and pumping in millions for renovations, the company closed it. The company spent another $26 million to demolish the building, taking a $125 million write-off.In 2000, Mr. Trump fired the chief executive and installed himself in the role, promising he would turn things around. The share price was by then hovering near $3.“Stock price is always a concern,” Mr. Trump told The Associated Press at the time. “I was focused very much on my Manhattan real estate over the last number of years. Now, I’m going to be focused much more in Atlantic City.”Though he has acknowledged mistakes in piling crippling debt on Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, Donald Trump has steadfastly maintained that his resorts were the best-run and highest-performing casinos in Atlantic City.“The casinos have done very well from a business standpoint,” he told Playboy magazine in 2004. “People agree that they’re well run, they look good and customers love them.”In reality, the revenue at Mr. Trump’s casinos had consistently lagged behind their competitors’ for a decade before larger forces ravaged the industry. Beginning in 1997, his share of the Atlantic City gambling market began to slip from its peak of 30 percent.Revenues at other Atlantic City casinos rose 18 percent from 1997 through 2002; Mr. Trump’s fell by 1 percent.Competition grew more intense in 2003, when the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa opened. The $1.1 billion, 40-story resort redefined the concept of an Atlantic City luxury casino. Revenues at Trump casinos dropped another 6 percent in a little more than a year.Had Mr. Trump’s revenues grown at the rate of other Atlantic City casinos, his company could have made its interest payments and possibly registered a profit. But with sagging revenues and high costs, his casinos had too little money for renovations and improvements, which are vital for hotels to attract guests. The public company never logged a profitable year.“There’s something not right when every single one of your projects doesn’t work out,” said Mr. Roffman, the casino analyst.In a recent interview, Mr. Trump attributed his declining market share in those years to the fact that his three casinos were competing with one another, a tacit acknowledgment that he overbuilt.“That was the bad news,” he said. “The good news is that I saved a lot of money in terms of dealing with costs.”The year the Borgata opened, Mr. Trump was already asking his bondholders to accept less money, in preparation for a third casino bankruptcy. Yet, at the same time, he managed to pull more money out of the company for himself, The Times found.Since taking Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts public, Mr. Trump had been bound by a “contribution agreement” that required him to engage in the gambling businesses only through his own company and banned him from personally owning more than 5 percent of the stock in any other casino company. So when he bought 10 percent of the shares in Riviera Hotel and Casino, a company based in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump was required to grant an option to purchase the shares to his public corporation.However, when Mr. Trump sold the Riviera shares in April 2004, the company, which was entitled to the proceeds, simply canceled the option, without explanation.The company’s description of the sale did not disclose Mr. Trump’s profit or how he had sold the shares. But in its securities filings, Riviera reported that Mr. Trump had sold the shares in a privately negotiated sale for $10 a share, well above the going price. That would have generated a gain of more than $1 million.Asked to review the transaction by The Times, James D. Cox, a professor at Duke University Law School who specializes in corporate and securities law, said such “material omissions of fact” in the filings by the Trump company could have resulted in criminal charges “if it is knowing and willful,” though such charges are rare.“I think the biggest thing is, it understates his compensation,” Mr. Cox said.At the time, the company was also asking its lenders for a break, and headed toward another bankruptcy.“Basically, that sounds like a fraudulent conveyance,” said David Skeel, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.“The company is throwing away money,” Professor Skeel said. “It’s the equivalent of giving big bonuses to your executives right before you file for bankruptcy.”But lawyers involved in the bankruptcy case said the transaction had apparently gone unnoticed.In a recent interview, Mr. Trump said that he did not recall the transaction or why the board had canceled its option.Months later, in November 2004, the company filed for bankruptcy protection, the third such trip for Trump casinos.This time bondholders took a $500 million loss. Mr. Trump, who stepped down as chief executive but remained chairman of the board, agreed to invest $55 million of his own money in the company, perhaps his first cash investment. He still received $2 million a year under a “services agreement,” which included the use of his name.Shares sometimes traded below a dollar, but Mr. Trump said the problems had been fixed.“For the first time ever, this will be a deleveraged company,” Mr. Trump told The Las Vegas Sun in 2005.Not everyone agreed. Mr. Trump’s longtime investment bankers at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette had backed out of a deal with Mr. Trump to invest in the company shortly before the bankruptcy was filed. Suing for $26 million in fees, the bankers said in court papers that the casinos would be back in bankruptcy court within five years because Mr. Trump’s revenue projections were too rosy and the company was still carrying too much debt.“The Trump name does not connote high-quality amenities and first-class service in the casino industry,” lawyers for the investment bank said. “Rather,” the Trump name is associated with “the failure to pay one’s debts, a company that has lost money every year, and properties in need of significant deferred maintenance and lagging behind their competitors.” (The dispute was later settled.)When Donald Trump has been pressed on his casinos’ performance during his presidential campaign, he has repeatedly said he left Atlantic City at the right time.“Atlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City,” he said during a Republican Party debate last September, according to a transcript. “I knew when to get out. My timing was great. And I got a lot of credit for it.”That would suggest Mr. Trump willingly left sometime around 2006, the year that revenues peaked in Atlantic City and that Pennsylvania allowed its first casino to open, a development that marked the start of a rapid downward spiral in the city. The drop-off was exacerbated by the recession that began in 2008.But in early 2009, as Trump casinos lurched toward bankruptcy for the fourth time, Mr. Trump was still trying to hang on. At loggerheads with board members who had been selected by bondholders after the 2004 bankruptcy, he offered to buy all or a part of the casino company bearing his name. He was rebuffed, and he quit the board soon after.Testifying in bankruptcy court in Camden, N.J., Mr. Trump argued that the company could not use his name, since shortly before filing the bankruptcy it had stopped paying him the $166,000 a month he received under the services agreement. He testified that his brand was worth $3 billion. He also testified that he was personally negotiating the settlement of a lawsuit in Florida that would yield more than $100 million for the company.And contradicting what he had said after the prior bankruptcy, he testified that the company’s debt load was still too high.“This time, the debt is being cut by a lot, and the company is really poised,” he said.There were odd moments on the stand. Mr. Trump, for example, vastly understated his role, saying he “became very much less involved with the company” during years when he was actually chairman of the board and chief executive, and “was on the board in a very minority position” during years when he had been chairman.As in previous cases, others warned that Mr. Trump’s promises should not be trusted. This time it was Carl C. Icahn, the activist investor who had a major stake in the company. (The two men now describe themselves as friends and Mr. Icahn supports Mr. Trump’s candidacy.)Mr. Icahn’s team argued that the remaining debt was still unsupportable, that the Trump name was replaceable, and that a windfall from the Florida lawsuit was wishful thinking. Under Mr. Trump, the company had a long history of making rosy revenue projections and never meeting them, Mr. Icahn’s lawyer argued.But a judge approved the Trump plan and noted that Mr. Trump and his supporters had established “that the Trump brand is worth millions of dollars” to the casinos.This time, bondholders gave up about $1.3 billion in exchange for control of the company. For the first time, Mr. Trump had no official role at the company he had founded, and he owned no more than 10 percent.In a recent interview, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he left Atlantic City when he did because he failed in his effort to buy back the casinos. But he said the timing worked out well for him, in the end.“In 2009 they were worth a hell of a lot more than they are now,” he said. “Sometimes you’re better off lucky than good.”Trump Marina was soon sold for $38 million, less than 10 percent of what the company paid Mr. Trump for it in 1996. The Plaza was shuttered. The Florida lawsuit that Mr. Trump had valued at more than $100 million produced nothing for the company. Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka sued the company, saying their brand was being tarnished by the ramshackle appearance of the Taj Mahal.Mr. Trump continued to earn money from the casinos. In 2011, the casinos reported leasing a Trump helicopter for $390,000 and spending $236,000 for “Trump labeled merchandise,” including $197,000 for Trump Ice bottled water.In retrospect, David Hanlon, a veteran casino executive who ran Merv Griffin’s Atlantic City operations at the time of the Resorts battle, said, Mr. Trump succeeded in repeatedly convincing investors, bankers and Wall Street that “his name had real value.”“They were so in love with him that they came back a second, third and fourth time,” Mr. Hanlon said. “They let him strip out assets. It was awful to watch. It was astonishing. I have to give Trump credit for using his celebrity time and time again.”In 2014, the casino company filed for bankruptcy protection for the fifth time. The chief executive cited the debt level after the 2009 bankruptcy as the primary reason.For a time, Mr. Trump lent a glamorous sheen to the faded resort city. But some of his former investors no longer see the value.“People underestimated Donald Trump’s ability to pillage the company,” said Sebastian Pignatello, a private investor who at one time held stock in the Trump casinos worth more than $500,000. “He drove these companies into bankruptcy by his mismanagement, the debt and his pillaging.”Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.AdvertisementSettingsCancelSetHave an existing account?Already have a subscription?Don't have an account?Among those who say billionaire didn't pay: dishwashers, painters, waitersSteve Reilly, USA TODAY
            Published 2:46 p.m. ET June 9, 2016 | Updated 1:42 p.m. ET April 25, 2018During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza.
The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder.
Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. “That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company… which has been around since my grandfather,” he said.Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will "protect your job." But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA TODAY NETWORK, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others.Trump’s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.USA TODAYLitigator in chiefIn addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic’s liens — filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work — since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren’t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.“Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely. That’s what the country should be doing.”The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether.Trump and his daughter Ivanka, in an interview with USA TODAY, shrugged off the lawsuits and other claims of non-payment. If a company or worker he hires isn’t paid fully, the Trumps said, it’s because The Trump Organization was unhappy with the work.“Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely,” Trump said. “That’s what the country should be doing.”To be sure, Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties.However, the consistent circumstances laid out in those lawsuits and other non-payment claims raise questions about Trump’s judgment as a businessman, and as a potential commander- in- chief. The number of companies and others alleging he hasn’t paid suggests that either his companies have a poor track record hiring workers and assessing contractors, or that Trump businesses renege on contracts, refuse to pay, or consistently attempt to change payment terms after work is complete as is alleged in dozens of court cases.In the interview, Trump repeatedly said the cases were “a long time ago.” However, even as he campaigns for the presidency, new cases are continuing. Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends. Trump’s team initially argued a contractor hired the workers, and he wasn’t responsible, and counter-sued the contractor demanding payment.“Trump could have settled it right off the bat, but they wanted to fight it out, that’s their M.O.” said Rod Hannah, of Plantation, Fla., the lawyer who represented the workers, who he said are forbidden from talking about the case in public. “They’re known for their aggressiveness, and if you have the money, why not?”Similar cases have cropped up with Trump’s facilities in California and New York, where hourly workers, bartenders and wait staff have sued with a range of allegations from not letting workers take breaks to not passing along tips to servers. Trump's company settled the California case, and the New York case is pending.“Trump’s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact with the witness.”Trump's Doral golf resort also has been embroiled in recent non-payment claims by two different paint firms, with one case settled and the other pending. Last month, his company’s refusal to pay one Florida painter more than $30,000 for work at Doral led the judge in the case to order foreclosure of the resort if the contractor isn’t paid.Juan Carlos Enriquez, owner of The Paint Spot, in South Florida, has been waiting more than two years to get paid for his work at the Doral. The Paint Spot first filed a lien against Trump’s course, then filed a lawsuit asking a Florida judge to intervene.In courtroom testimony, the manager of the general contractor for the Doral renovation admitted that a decision was made not to pay The Paint Spot because Trump “already paid enough.” As the construction manager spoke, “Trump’s trial attorneys visibly winced, began breathing heavily, and attempted to make eye contact” with the witness, the judge noted in his ruling.That, and other evidence, convinced the judge The Paint Spot’s claim was credible. He ordered last month that the Doral resort be foreclosed on, sold, and the proceeds used to pay Enriquez the money he was owed. Trump’s attorneys have since filed a motion to delay the sale, and the contest continues.Enriquez still hasn’t been paid.Trump frequently boasts that he will bring jobs back to America, including Tuesday in a primary-election night victory speech at his golf club in suburban New York City. “No matter who you are, we're going to protect your job,” Trump said Tuesday. “Because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we're babies.”But the lawsuits show Trump’s organization wages Goliath vs David legal battles over small amounts of money that are negligible to the billionaire and his executives — but devastating to his much-smaller foes.In 2007, for instance, dishwasher Guy Dorcinvil filed a federal lawsuit against Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach, Fla., alleging the club failed to pay time-and-a-half for overtime he worked over three years and the company failed to keep proper time records for employees.Aerial view of Mar-a-Lago, the oceanfront estate of Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Fla., on Jan. 22, 2005.(Photo: New York Daily News via Getty Images)Mar-a-Lago LLC agreed to pay Dorcinvil $7,500 to settle the case in 2008. The terms of the settlement agreement includes a standard statement that Mar-a-Lago does not admit fault and forbids Dorcinvil or his lawyers from talking about the case, according to court records.Developers with histories of not paying contractors are a very small minority of the industry, said Colette Nelson, chief advocacy officer of the American Subcontractors Association. But late or missing payments can be devastating for small businesses and their employees.“Real estate is a tough and aggressive business, but most business people don’t set out to make their money by breaking the companies that they do business with,” she said, stressing she couldn’t speak directly to the specifics of cases in Trump’s record. “But there are a few.”In the interview, Trump said that complaints represent a tiny fraction of his business empire and dealings with contractors and employees, insisting all are paid fairly. “We pay everybody what they’re supposed to be paid, and we pay everybody on time,” he said. “And we employ thousands and thousands of people. OK?”Despite the Trumps’ assertion that his their companies only refuse payment to contractors “when somebody does a bad job,” he has sometimes offered to hire those same contractors again. It’s a puzzling turn of events, since most people who have a poor experience with a contractor, and who refuse to pay and even fight the contractor in court, aren’t likely to offer to rehire them.Donald Trump, right, waits with his brother Robert for the start of a Casino Control Commission meeting in Atlantic City on March 29, 1990. Trump was seeking final approval for the Taj Mahal Casino Resort, one of the world's largest casino complexes.(Photo: AP)Nevertheless, such was the case for the Friels. After submitting the final bill for the Plaza casino cabinet-building in 1984, Paul Friel said he got a call asking that his father, Edward, come to the Trump family’s offices at the casino for a meeting. There Edward, and some other contractors, were called in one by one to meet with Donald Trump and his brother, Robert Trump.“He sat in a room with nine guys,” Paul Friel said. “We found out some of them were carpet guys. Some of them were glass guys. Plumbers. You name it.”In the meeting, Donald Trump told his father that the company’s work was inferior, Friel said, even though the general contractor on the casino had approved it. The bottom line, Trump told Edward Friel, was the company wouldn't get the final payment. Then, Friel said Trump added something that struck the family as bizarre. Trump told his dad that he could work on other Trump projects in the future.“Wait a minute,” Paul Friel said, recalling his family's reaction to his dad’s account of the meeting. “Why would the Trump family want a company who they say their work is inferior to work for them in the future?”“We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly. But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn’t do that.”Asked about the meeting this week, Trump said, “Was the work bad? Was it bad work?” And, then, after being told that the general contractor had approved it, Trump added, “Well, see here’s the thing. You’re talking about, what, 30 years ago?”Ivanka Trump added that any number of disputes over late or deficient payments that were found over the past few decades pale in comparison to the thousands of checks Trump companies cut each month.“We have hundreds of millions of dollars of construction projects underway. And we have, for the most part, exceptional contractors on them who get paid, and get paid quickly,” she said, adding that she doubted any contractor complaining in court or in the press would admit they delivered substandard work. “But it would be irresponsible if my father paid contractors who did lousy work. And he doesn’t do that.”But, the Friels’ story is similar to experiences of hundreds of other contractors over the casino-boom decade in Atlantic City. Legal records, New Jersey Casino Control Commission records and contemporaneous local newspaper stories recounted time and again tales about the Trumps paying late or renegotiating deals for dimes on the dollar.Donald Trump stands next to a genie lamp as the lights of his Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort light up the evening sky marking the grand opening of the venture in Atlantic City on April 5, 1990.(Photo: Mike Derer, AP)A half-decade after the Friels’ encounter, in 1990, as Trump neared the opening of his third Atlantic City casino, he was once again attempting to pay contractors less than he owed. In casino commission records of an audit, it was revealed that Trump’s companies owed a total of $69.5 million to 253 subcontractors on the Taj Mahal project. Some already had sued Trump, the state audit said; others were negotiating with Trump to try to recover what they could. The companies and their hundreds of workers had installed walls, chandeliers, plumbing, lighting and even the casino’s trademark minarets.One of the builders was Marty Rosenberg, vice president of Atlantic Plate Glass Co., who said he was owed about $1.5 million for work at the Taj Mahal. When it became clear Trump was not going to pay in full, Rosenberg took on an informal leadership role, representing about 100 to 150 contractors in negotiations with Trump.Rosenberg’s mission: with Trump offering as little as 30 cents on the dollar to some of the contractors, Rosenberg wanted to get as much as he could for the small businesses, most staffed by younger tradesmen with modest incomes and often families to support.“Yes, there were a lot of other companies," he said of those Trump left waiting to get paid. "Yes, some did not survive."Rosenberg said his company was among the lucky ones. He had to delay paying his own suppliers to the project. The negotiations led to him eventually getting about 70 cents on the dollar for his work, and he was able to pay all of his suppliers in full.The analysis of Trump lawsuits also found that professionals, such as real estate agents and lawyers, say he's refused to pay them sizable sums of money. Those cases show that even some loyal employees, those selling his properties and fighting for him in court, are only with him until they’re not.Real estate broker Rana Williams, who said she had sold hundreds of millions of dollars in Manhattan property for Trump International Realty over more than two decades with the company, sued in 2013 alleging Trump shorted her $735,212 in commissions on deals she brokered from 2009 to 2012. Williams, who managed as many as 16 other sales agents for Trump, said the tycoon and his senior deputies decided to pay her less than her contracted commission rate “based on nothing more than whimsy.”Trump and Williams settled their case in 2015, and the terms of the deal are confidential, as is the case in dozens of other settlements between plaintiffs and Trump companies.However, Williams' 2014 deposition in the case is not sealed. In her sworn testimony, Williams said the 2013 commission shortage wasn't the only one, and neither was she the only person who didn't get fully paid. “There were instances where a sizable commission would come in and we would be waiting for payment and it wouldn’t come,” she testified. “That was both for myself and for some of the agents.”Another broker, Jennifer McGovern, filed a similar lawsuit against the now-defunct Trump Mortgage LLC in 2007, citing a six-figure commission on real-estate sales that she said went unpaid. A judge issued a judgment ordering Trump Mortgage to pay McGovern $298,274.Even Trump’s own attorneys, on several occasions, sued him over claims of unpaid bills.One law firm that fought contractors over payments and other issues for Trump — New York City’s Morrison Cohen LLP — ended up on the other side of a similar battle with the mogul in 2008. Trump didn’t like that its lawyers were using his name in press releases touting its representation of Trump in a lawsuit against a construction contractor that Trump claimed overcharged him for work on a luxury golf club.As Trump now turned his ire on his former lawyers, however, Morrison Cohen counter-sued. In court records, the law firm alleged Trump didn’t pay nearly a half million dollars in legal fees. Trump and his ex-lawyers settled their disputes out of court, confidentially, in 2009.In 2012, Virginia-based law firm Cook, Heyward, Lee, Hopper & Feehan filed a lawsuit against the Trump Organization for $94,511 for legal fees and costs. The case was eventually settled out of court. But as the case unfolded, court records detail how Trump's senior deputies attacked the attorneys' quality of work in the local and trade press, leading the firm to make claims of defamation that a judge ultimately rejected on free speech grounds.Trump claims in his presidential personal financial disclosure to be worth $10 billion as a result of his business acumen. Many of the small contractors and individuals who weren’t paid by him haven’t been as fortunate.Edward Friel, left, and his wife, owned a family cabinetry business that says it was badly harmed by non-payment on a big contract at one of Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos.(Photo: Photo courtesy of Friel family)Edward Friel, of the Philadelphia cabinetry company allegedly shortchanged for the casino work, hired a lawyer to sue for the money, said his son, Paul Friel. But the attorney advised him that the Trumps would drag the case out in court and legal fees would exceed what they’d recover.The unpaid bill took a huge chunk out of the bottom line of the company that Edward ran to take care of his wife and five kids. “The worst part wasn’t dealing with the Trumps,” Paul Friel said. After standing up to Trump, Friel said the family struggled to get other casino work in Atlantic City. “There’s tons of these stories out there,” he said.The Edward J.

Eighteen years ago, Wojciech Kozak helped build Trump Tower, the skyscraper jewel in Donald J. Trump's real-estate empire. Today, Mr. Kozak recalls that time with nightmare memories of backbreaking 12-hour shifts and of being cheated with 200 other undocumented Polish immigrants out of meager wages and fringe benefits.''We worked in horrid, terrible conditions,'' Mr. Kozak said of the six months he spent in 1980 wielding a sledgehammer and a blowtorch in demolishing the Bonwit Teller Building on Fifth Avenue to make way for Trump Tower. ''We were frightened illegal immigrants and did not know enough about our rights.''Mr. Kozak, like other laborers on that job, has no hope of collecting about $4,000 in back wages from a contracting company that began the demolition and later became insolvent. But after almost two decades, the demolition workers are still struggling to compel Mr. Trump and his business associates to compensate a union's welfare funds and thus increase pension and medical benefits for some of the Polish workers.Mr. Kozak is now a party and witness in a class-action lawsuit that has meandered through the Federal courts for 15 years and charges that Mr. Trump owes $4 million to the union welfare funds for the work the Poles performed. Filed in 1983, the suit has been bogged down by a torrent of motions and appeals of judicial decisions and by the deaths of a judge, a lawyer, the original lead plaintiffs, an important witness and two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants.AdvertisementIn an effort to resolve the tangled case -- one of the oldest on the civil dockets of the Federal District Court in Manhattan -- Judge Kevin T. Duffy last month warned lawyers for both sides to be prepared to begin a jury trial on 48 hours' notice.AdvertisementBut on Thursday, in a development that could delay the trial yet again, Judge Duffy ordered the case assigned to another judge. Lawyers for both sides said the 48-hour notice was still in effect, but that it was unclear when the trial would start.Mr. Trump denies that he was aware of the working conditions at the site in 1980 or that any of the demolition workers were undocumented immigrants. He is also chal lenging claims that he is liable for payments to the union that were evaded by the demolition contractor.''All we did was to try to keep a job going that was started by someone else,'' Mr. Trump, in an interview, said of his company's efforts to guarantee that the demolition contractor paid wages to employees. ''In fact, we helped people and it has cost a lot of money in legal fees.''Mr. Kozak and other Polish immigrants who were hired for the demolition said in interviews that they often worked in choking clouds of asbestos dust without protective equipment. They accepted the conditions because they thought the job would pay 10 times as much as they could earn in Poland, said Mr. Kozak, 56, a slightly built man who became an American citizen and joined a laborers' union.Julian Nalepa, 63, who suffered a head injury in the demolition, said he and fellow workers were baffled by the unending suit. ''It makes you think that only the rich have rights in the courts,'' he said.The demolition project on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street lasted from January to June 1980. It cleared the way for an ornate 68-story glass-sheathed structure containing shops and an atrium on the lower floors and 263 condominium apartments above that originally sold for $500,000 to $10 million each.The tower was financed and built by Mr. Trump's development company, the Trump Organization, and the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States.AdvertisementAccording to court records and testimony, the Trump-Equitable joint venture hired Kaszycki and Sons Contractors Inc. at a fee of $775,000 to raze Bonwit Teller's 10-story flagship department store although the contractor had little demolition experience. Demolition Workers Local 95 of the Laborers' International Union of North America had a collective bargaining agreement with the Kaszycki company, of Herkimer, N.Y., requiring it to pay specified wages to union and nonunion workers at the Trump Tower site and to make additional payments for each worker into the local's pension and medical insurance funds.Wendy E. Sloan and Lewis M. Steel, lawyers for current and retired Local 95 members in the suit, assert that William Kaszycki, owner of the contracting company, hired about 200 Polish immigrants who were not Local 95 members and agreed to pay them $4 to $5 an hour on 12-hour shifts seven days a week.The Kaszycki company, the plaintiffs said, violated the union's $11-an-hour minimum wage scale and made payments to the local's welfare funds for only 12 to 15 employees. The contractor also failed to pay the 200 Poles their full wages, causing work stoppages and delays.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.The plaintiffs contend that Mr. Trump was desperate to meet demolition and construction deadlines and that his company in May 1980 began supervising the demolition, assuming full responsibility for adhering to the union contract and for the payments to the union welfare funds.When the suit was filed in 1983, the lead plaintiff was Harry J. Diduck, a dissident member of Local 95. Mr. Diduck had not worked at Trump Tower but maintained that that he and about 500 Local 95 members and retirees lost medical and pension benefits because Trump-Equitable and the Kaszycki company owed the union funds more than $300,000.After eight years of arguments and a nonjury trial on some of the issues, in 1991 Judge Charles E. Stewart of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Trump and his associates conspired with Local 95's president, John Senyshyn, to withhold payments to the funds. He determined that Trump-Equitable owed $325,415 plus interest.Both sides, however, appealed the findings and each won partial victories. A Federal appeals court upheld most of Judge Stewart's decisions but ruled that Trump-Equitable had been denied a full opportunity to rebut the charge that the funds had been damaged by the loss of contributions for the Polish workers.The appeals court also ruled that Judge Stewart wrongly dismissed a claim by the plaintiffs that the Trump group was responsible for payments to the funds because it had been the workers' actual employer.Judge Stewart died in October 1994 and the case, with new issues at stake, was assigned to Judge Duffy. But progress was further hampered by the deaths since 1991 of Mr. Diduck, the original plaintiff; Burton H. Hall, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, and Mr. Kaszycki and Mr. Senyshyn, who were co-defendants.AdvertisementBefore ordering lawyers to be ready for trial on two days' notice, Judge Duffy recently denied motions for further delays.Admonishing both sides, he said, ''There must be an end to all litigation: even Jarndyce v. Jarndyce ground down to a conclusion.'' He was referring to an estate dispute in Charles Dickens's novel ''Bleak House'' involving generations of the Jarndyce family that was so convoluted no one understood it.Edwin G. Schallert, the chairman of the Federal Court Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, described the Trump case's longevity as ''extraordinarily rare'' for the District Court. Mr. Schallert said records show that the average civil suit in the court takes 29 months and that 90 percent of cases are tried within four years.At different stages, Mr. Trump has retained four prominent Manhattan law firms to represent him. ''The legal history of this case is a jigsaw puzzle,'' said Thomas A. Bolan, Mr. Trump's latest lawyer and a former partner of the late Roy M. Cohn. ''We are now back to square one on the key issues.''Mr. Trump, who is expected to testify at the trial, said he had resisted efforts to settle the case out of court. ''It would be cheaper, but on principle I won't,'' he said. ''We did nothing wrong.''Ms. Sloan, the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, said she would be paid for 15 years of legal work only if her side won. The fees would be set by by the court, she added, and would be paid by Mr. Trump and his co-defendants. She estimated that if the $300,000 judgment, and accumulated interest, is upheld a second time, the payments would reach about $4 million.''When you are facing large firms, it tends to make the litigation protracted,'' said Ms. Sloan, who is a solo practitioner specializing in union and civil rights law.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has placed immigration at the core of his presidential campaign. He has claimed that undocumented immigrants are “taking our jobs” and “taking our money,” pledged to deport them en masse, and vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border. At one point he demanded a ban on Muslims entering the country. Speaking to supporters in Iowa on Saturday, Trump said he would crack down on visitors to the United States who overstay their visas and declared that when any American citizen “loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated.” And he is scheduled to give a major address on immigration in Arizona on Wednesday night.But the mogul’s New York modeling agency, Trump Model Management, has profited from using foreign models who came to the United States on tourist visas that did not permit them to work here, according to three former Trump models, all noncitizens, who shared their stories with Mother Jones. Financial and immigration records included in a recent lawsuit filed by a fourth former Trump model show that she, too, worked for Trump’s agency in the United States without a proper visa.Foreigners who visit the United States as tourists are generally not permitted to engage in any sort of employment unless they obtain a special visa, a process that typically entails an employer applying for approval on behalf of a prospective employee. Employers risk fines and possible criminal charges for using undocumented labor.Founded in 1999, Trump Model Management “has risen to the top of the fashion market,” boasts the Trump Organization’s website, and has a name “that symbolizes success.” According to a financial disclosure filed by his campaign in May, Donald Trump earned nearly $2 million from the company, in which he holds an 85 percent stake. Meanwhile, some former Trump models say they barely made any money working for the agency because of the high fees for rent and other expenses that were charged by the company.  Canadian-born Rachel Blais spent nearly three years working for Trump Model Management. After first signing with the agency in March 2004, she said, she performed a series of modeling gigs for Trump’s company in the United States without a work visa. At Mother Jones‘ request, Blais provided a detailed financial statement from Trump Model Management and a letter from an immigration lawyer who, in the fall of 2004, eventually secured a visa that would permit her to work legally in the United States. These records show a six-month gap between when she began working in the United States and when she was granted a work visa. During that time, Blais appeared on Trump’s hit reality TV show, The Apprentice, modeling outfits designed by his business protégés. As Blais walked the runway, Donald Trump looked on from the front row.Two other former Trump models—who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, and who we are giving the pseudonyms Anna and Kate—said the agency never obtained work visas on their behalf, even as they performed modeling assignments in the United States. (They provided photographs from some of these jobs, and Mother Jones confirmed with the photographers or stylists that these shoots occurred in the United States.)Each of the three former Trump models said she arrived in New York with dreams of making it big in one of the world’s most competitive fashion markets. But without work visas, they lived in constant fear of getting caught. “I was pretty on edge most of the time I was there,” Anna said of the three months in 2009 she spent in New York working for Trump’s agency.“I was there illegally,” she said. “A sitting duck.”According to three immigration lawyers consulted by Mother Jones, even unpaid employment is against the law for foreign nationals who do not have a work visa. “If the US company is benefiting from that person, that’s work,” explained Anastasia Tonello, global head of the US immigration team at Laura Devine Attorneys in New York. These rules for immigrants are in place to “protect them from being exploited,” she said. “That US company shouldn’t be making money off you.”Two of the former Trump models said Trump’s agency encouraged them to deceive customs officials about why they were visiting the United States and told them to lie on customs forms about where they intended to live. Anna said she received a specific instruction from a Trump agency representative: “If they ask you any questions, you’re just here for meetings.”Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, declined to answer questions about Trump Model Management’s use of foreign labor. “That has nothing to do with me or the campaign,” she said, adding that she had referred Mother Jones‘ queries to Trump’s modeling agency. Mother Jones also sent detailed questions to Trump Model Management. The company did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.Fashion industry sources say that skirting immigration law in the manner that the three former Trump models described was once commonplace in the modeling world. In fact, Politico recently raised questions about the immigration status of Donald Trump’s current wife, Melania, during her days as a young model in New York in the 1990s. (In response to the Politico story, Melania Trump said she has “at all times been in compliance with the immigration laws of this country.”)Kate, who worked for Trump Model Management in 2004, marveled at how her former boss has recently branded himself as an anti-illegal-immigration crusader on the campaign trail. “He doesn’t want to let anyone into the US anymore,” she said. “Meanwhile, behind everyone’s back, he’s bringing in all of these girls from all over the world and they’re working illegally.”Now 31 years old and out of the modeling business, Blais once appeared in various publications, including Vogue, Elle, and Harpers Bazaar, and she posed wearing the designs of such fashion luminaries as Gianfranco Ferré, Dolce & Gabbana, and Jean Paul Gaultier. Her modeling career began when she was 16 and spanned numerous top-name agencies across four continents. She became a vocal advocate for models and appeared in a 2011 documentary, Girl Model, that explored the darker side of the industry. In a recent interview, she said her experience with Trump’s firm stood out: “Honestly, they are the most crooked agency I’ve ever worked for, and I’ve worked for quite a few.”Freshly signed to Trump Model Management, the Montreal native traveled to New York City by bus in April 2004. Just like “the majority of models who are young, [have] never been to NYC, and don’t have papers, I was just put in Trump’s models’ apartment,” she said. Kate and Anna also said they had lived in this apartment.Models’ apartments, as they’re known in the industry, are dormitory-style quarters where agencies pack their talent into bunks, in some cases charging the models sky-high rent and pocketing a profit. According to the three former models, Trump Model Management housed its models in a two-floor, three-bedroom apartment in the East Village, near Tompkins Square Park. Mother Jones is withholding the address of the building, which is known in the neighborhood for its model tenants, to protect the privacy of the current residents.When Blais lived in the apartment, she recalled, a Trump agency representative who served as a chaperone had a bedroom to herself on the ground floor of the building. A narrow flight of stairs led down to the basement, where the models lived in two small bedrooms that were crammed with bunk beds—two in one room, three in the other. An additional mattress was located in a common area near the stairs. At times, the apartment could be occupied by 11 or more people.“We’re herded into these small spaces,” Kate said. “The apartment was like a sweatshop.”Trump Model Management recruited models as young as 14. “I was by far the oldest in the house at the ripe old age of 18,” Anna said. “The bathroom always smelled like burned hair. I will never forget the place!” She added, “I taught myself how to write, ‘Please clean up after yourself’ in Russian.”Living in the apartment during a sweltering New York summer, Kate picked a top bunk near a street-level window in the hopes of getting a little fresh air. She awoke one morning to something splashing her face. “Oh, maybe it’s raining today,” she recalled thinking. But when she peered out the window, “I saw the one-eyed monster pissing on me,” she said. “There was a bum pissing on my window, splashing me in my Trump Model bed.”“Such a glamorous industry,” she said.Blais, who previously discussed some of her experiences in an interview with Public Radio International, said the models weren’t in a position to complain about their living arrangements. “You’re young,” she remarked, “and you know that if you ask too many questions, you’re not going to get the work.”A detailed financial statement provided by Blais shows that Trump’s agency charged her as much as $1,600 a month for a bunk in a room she shared with five others. Kate said she paid about $1,200 a month—”highway robbery,” she called it. For comparison, in the summer of 2004, an entire studio apartment nearby was advertised at $1,375 a month.From April to October 2004, Blais traveled between the United States and Europe, picking up a string of high-profile fashion assignments for Trump Model Management and making a name for herself in the modeling world. During the months she spent living and working in New York, Blais said, she only had a tourist visa. “Most of the girls in the apartment that were not American didn’t have a work visa,” she recalled.Anna and Kate also said they each worked for Trump’s agency while holding tourist visas. “I started out doing test-shoots but ended up doing a couple of lookbooks,” Anna said. (A lookbook is a modeling portfolio.) “Nothing huge, but definitely shoots that classified as ‘work.'”Employers caught hiring noncitizens without proper visas can be fined up to $16,000 per employee and, in some cases, face up to six months in prison.The three former Trump models said Trump’s agency was aware of the complications posed by their foreign status. Anna and Kate said the company coached them on how to circumvent immigration laws. Kate recalled being told, “When you’re stuck at immigration, say that you’re coming as a tourist. If they go through your luggage and they find your portfolio, tell them that you’re going there to look for an agent.”Anna recalled that prior to her arrival, Trump agency staffers were “dodging around” her questions about her immigration status and how she could work legally in the United States. “Until finally,” she said, “it came to two days before I left, and they told me my only option was to get a tourist visa and we could work the rest out when I got there. We never sorted the rest out.”Arriving in the United States, Anna grew terrified. “Going through customs for this trip was one of the most nerve-wracking experiences of my life,” she added. “It’s hard enough when you’re there perfectly innocently, but when you know you’ve lied on what is essentially a federal document, it’s a whole new world.”“Am I sweaty? Am I red? Am I giving this away?” Anna remembered thinking as she finally faced a customs officer. After making it through immigration, she burst into tears.Industry experts say that violating immigration rules has been the status quo in the fashion world for years. “It’s been common, almost standard, for modeling agencies to encourage girls to come into the country illegally,” said Sara Ziff, the founder of the Model Alliance, an advocacy group that claimed a major success in 2014 after lobbying the New York State legislature to pass a bill increasing protections for child models.Bringing models into the United States on tourist visas was “very common,” said Susan Scafidi, the director of Fordham University’s Fashion Law Institute. “I’ve had tons of agencies tell me this, that this used to happen all the time, and that the cover story might be something like ‘I’m coming in for a friend’s birthday,’ or ‘I’m coming in to visit my aunt,’ that sort of thing.”For their part, modeling agencies have complained about the time and resources required to bring a foreign model into the country and have insisted that US immigration laws are out of step with their fast-paced industry. “If there are girls that we can’t get into the United States, the client is going to take that business elsewhere,” Corinne Nicolas, the president of Trump Model Management, told the New York Daily News in 2008. “The market is calling for foreign girls.”In 2007, a few years before his career imploded in a sexting scandal, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) sponsored a bill that would give models the same kind of work visas that international entertainers and athletes receive. The tabloids had a field day­—”Give me your torrid, your pure, your totally smokin’ foreign babes,” screamed a Daily News headline—and the effort ultimately failed.Trump Model Management sponsored only its most successful models for work visas, the three former models said. Those who didn’t cut it were sent home, as was the case, Blais noted, with many of her roommates.“It was very much the case of you earn your visa,” Anna said. “Essentially, if you got enough work and they liked you enough, they’d pay for a visa, but you weren’t about to see a dime before you could prove your worth.”The company eventually secured an H-1B visa for Blais. Such visas allow US companies to employ workers in specialized fields. According to financial records provided by Blais, the company deducted the costs of obtaining a work visa from her earnings. (The agency did not obtain work visas for Anna and Kate, who each left the United States after their stints with Trump Model Management.)H-1B visas have been increasingly popular in the high-tech field, and Trump’s companies, including Trump Model Management, have used this program extensively in the past. But on the campaign trail, Trump has railed against the H-1B program and those who he says abuse it. “I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program,” Trump said in March. “No exceptions.”Nearly three years after signing with Trump’s agency, Blais had little to show for it—and it wasn’t for lack of modeling jobs. Under the contracts that she and other Trump models had signed, the company advanced money for rent and various other expenses (such as trainers, beauty treatments, travel, and administrative costs), deducting these charges from its clients’ modeling fees. But these charges—including the pricey rent that Blais and her roommates paid—consumed nearly all her modeling earnings. “I only got one check from Trump Models, and that’s when I left them,” she said. “I got $8,000 at most after having worked there for three years and having made tens of thousands of dollars.” (The check Blais received was for $8,427.35.)“This is a system where they actually end up making money on the back of these foreign workers,” Blais added. She noted that models can end up in debt to their agencies, once rent and numerous other fees are extracted.This is known in the industry as “agency debt.” Kate said her bookings never covered the cost of living in New York. After two months, she returned home. “I left indebted to them,” she said, “and I never went back, and I never paid them back.”The experiences the former Trump models related to Mother Jones echo allegations in an ongoing class-action lawsuit against six major modeling agencies by nine former models who have claimed their agencies charged them exorbitant fees for rent and other expenses. One plaintiff, Marcelle Almonte, has alleged that her agency charged her $1,850 per month to live in a two-bedroom Miami Beach apartment with eight other models. The market rate for apartments in the same building ran no more than $3,300 per month, according to the complaint. (Trump Model Management, which was initially named in an earlier version of this lawsuit, was dropped from the case in 2013, after the judge narrowed the number of defendants.) Models “were largely trapped by these circumstances if they wanted to continue to pursue a career in modeling,” the complaint alleges.“It is like modern-day slavery” Blais said of working for Trump Model Management—and she is not alone in describing her time with Trump’s company in those terms. Former Trump model Alexia Palmer, who filed a lawsuit against Trump Model Management for fraud and wage theft in 2014, has said she “felt like a slave.”Palmer has alleged that she was forced to pay hefty—sometimes mysterious—fees to Trump’s agency. These were fees on top of the 20 percent commission she paid for each job the company booked. Palmer charged that during three years of modeling for Trump’s company, she earned only $3,880.75. A New York judge dismissed Palmer’s claim in March because, among other reasons, she had not taken her case first to the Department of Labor. Lawyers for Trump Model Management called Palmer’s lawsuit “frivolous” and “without merit.”Palmer filed a complaint with the Department of Labor this spring, and in August the agency dismissed the case. Palmer’s lawyer, Naresh Gehi, said he is appealing the decision. Since he began representing Palmer, he said, fashion models who worked for other agencies have approached him with similar stories. “These are people that are coming out of the closet and explaining to the world how they are being exploited,” he said. “They are the most vulnerable.”Documents filed in Palmer’s case indicate that she worked in the United States without a work visa after being recruited by Trump’s agency from her native Jamaica. Gehi declined to discuss his client’s immigration status.A Caribbean model contest launched Palmer’s career in 2010, and at age 17 she signed an exclusive contract with Trump Model Management in January 2011. Department of Labor records show she received approval to work in the United States beginning in October 2011. Yet according to a financial statement filed as evidence in her case, Palmer started working in the United States nine months before this authorization was granted. Her financial records list a January 22, 2011, job for Condé Nast, when she posed for a Teen Vogue spread featuring the cast of Glee. (The shoot took place at Milk Studios in Los Angeles.)“That whole period, from January to September, was not authorized,” said Pankaj Malik, a partner at New York-based Ballon, Stoll, Bader & Nadler who has worked on immigration issues for over two decades and who reviewed Palmer’s case for Mother Jones. “You can’t do any of that. It’s so not allowed.”Trump has taken an active role at Trump Model Management from its founding. He has personally signed models who have participated in his Miss Universe and Miss USA competitions, where his agency staff appeared as judges. Melania Trump was a Trump model for a brief period after meeting her future husband in the late 1990s.The agency is a particular point of pride for Trump, who has built his brand around glitz and glamour. “True Trumpologists know the model agency is only a tiny part of Trumpland financially,” the New York Sun wrote in 2004. “But his agency best evokes a big Trump theme—sex sells.” Trump has often cross-pollinated his other business ventures with fashion models and has used them as veritable set pieces when he rolls out new products. Trump models, including Blais, appeared on The Apprentice—and they flanked him at the 2004 launch of his Parker Brothers board game, TRUMP.Part of Blais’ job, she said, was to serve as eye candy at Trump-branded events. Recalling the first time she met the mogul, she said, “I had to go to the Trump Vodka opening.” It was a glitzy 2006 gala at Trump Tower where Busta Rhymes performed, and Trump unveiled his (soon-to-be-defunct) line of vodka. “It was part of my duty to go and be seen and to be photographed and meet Donald Trump and shake his hand,” she remembered.Trump made a strong impression on her that night. “I knew that I was a model and there was objectification in the job, but this was another level,” she said. Blais left Trump Model Management the year after the Trump Vodka gala, feeling that she had been exploited and shortchanged by the agency.Kate, who went on to have a successful career with another agency, also parted ways with Trump’s company in disgust. “My overall experience was not a very good one,” she said. “I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I didn’t like the agency. I didn’t like where they had us living. Honestly, I felt ripped off.”These days, Kate said, she believes that Trump has been fooling American voters with his anti-immigrant rhetoric, given that his own agency had engaged in the practices he has denounced. “He doesn’t like the face of a Mexican or a Muslim,” she said, “but because these [models] are beautiful girls, it’s okay? He’s such a hypocrite.”window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={"beacon":"bam.nr-data.net","licenseKey":"949ceaf672","applicationID":"42428067","transactionName":"MQZWYhAFXhdYAUBfWwhMdVUWDV8KFhFdWFMKBhlQFwhcO04LUEJcOQJGQgsHXAE=","queueTime":0,"applicationTime":185,"atts":"HUFBFFgfTUgbAxYMTxse","errorBeacon":"bam.nr-data.net","agent":""}Subscribe to our free newsletters.Mother Jones was founded as a nonprofit in 1976 because we knew corporations and the wealthy wouldn't fund the type of hard-hitting journalism we set out to do.

Digital Networks announced Friday.The move appeared to be the latest by WarnerMedia, under AT&T’s ownership, to streamline operations by cutting niche-oriented business ventures. Two sources familiar with the decision said the plan to kill FilmStruck was made prior to AT&T’s closing the Time Warner deal; in any case, the strategy aligns with the new WarnerMedia blueprint to shift resources to mass-market entertainment services.The FilmStruck business will cease U.S. and international operations on Nov. 29, 2018, and the service stopped accepting signups on Oct. 26. A Turner rep declined to comment on how many employees will be affected by the closure or provide info on how many employees work on FilmStruck. 






In a statement, Turner and WB Digital Networks said, “We’re incredibly proud of the creativity and innovations produced by the talented and dedicated teams who worked on FilmStruck over the past two years. While FilmStruck has a very loyal fanbase, it remains largely a niche service. We plan to take key learnings from FilmStruck to help shape future business decisions in the direct-to-consumer space and redirect this investment back into our collective portfolios.”RELATED: Directors, Fans React to FilmStruck ShutdownThe shutdown of FilmStruck, which debuted in November 2016, comes after two other WarnerMedia digital units have gotten the axe.Warner Bros. Digital Networks’ DramaFever, a subscription VOD service specializing in Korean dramas, was abruptly shut down on Oct. 16. One week ago, Turner announced that it was pulling the plug on edgy digital-content and TV studio Super Deluxe.AT&T earlier this month signaled that it would move to restructure the WarnerMedia video-streaming portfolio. As part of announcing plans for a broad subscription-streaming entertainment service anchored by HBO that would pull in content from other parts of WarnerMedia, AT&T said it would be “consolidating resources from sub-scale D2C [direct-to-consumer] efforts.”A source familiar with AT&T’s strategy said the telco is looking to eliminate peripheral projects that aren’t major producers of revenue. “They felt Time Warner overall had too many initiatives,” the exec said. “[AT&T] have their hands full. They have no time to think about, ‘What do we do with this growth property?'”FilmStruck offered a lineup of some 1,800 contemporary and classic arthouse, indie, foreign and cult films and also was the exclusive internet-streaming home to the Criterion Collection of movies. Earlier this year, it added Warner Bros.’ library of classic films; WB shut down the Warner Archive service and migrated customers over to FilmStruck. The service was priced at $10.99 per month with access to the Criterion Collection library, and $6.99 monthly without it.FilmStruck was developed and managed by Turner Classic Movies (TCM) in conjunction with Warner Bros. Digital Networks, overseen by Coleman Breland, Turner’s president of content experiences and president of TCM and FilmStruck. The companies declined to disclose how many subscribers FilmStruck had signed up. 






Titles on FilmStruck had included “Casablanca,” “Rebel Without a Cause,” “Singin’ in the Rain,” “Citizen Kane,” “The Music Man,” “Bringing Up Baby,” “The Thin Man” and “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” from Warner Bros.

  By Sid PerkinsApr. 25, 2011 , 4:42 PM 		An abnormally high fraction of the ash particles spewed skyward by Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano last April were small and sharp and 		therefore posed high risks to airplanes and human health, a new study suggests. That means the 7-day shutdown of much of Europe's air traffic ordered 		by civil aviation authorities, which affected 10 million passengers and cost between €1.5 billion and €2.5 billion, was likely worth it. 	 		Eyjafjallajökull began erupting on 20 March 2010. For the first couple of weeks, lava oozed from a fissure on its ice-free flank, and the 		resulting ash plume was anything but impressive. On 14 April, however, molten rock began flowing from the ice-filled crater at the mountain's peak, and 		the eruption became explosive. The resulting plume of ash wafted southeast over Europe and triggered the largest disruption of the continent's air 		traffic since World War II. 	 		The debate about whether and when to shut down air traffic, as well as when to reopen the skies to aircraft, was largely a matter of economics versus 		safety. "It was a matter of losing big bucks versus losing people," says Susan Stipp, a geochemist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Tiny 		particles of ash sandblast the windows and flight surfaces of any aircraft passing through even a diffuse volcanic plume, thereby blocking a pilot's 		view forward. What's more, the particles melt when exposed to the hellish temperatures inside a jet engine and can stick to turbine blades, disrupting 		airflow and stalling the engines-and possibly causing the plane to crash. 	 Eyjafjallajökull's ash was particularly hazardous, according to an analysis reported by Stipp and colleagues online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The steam 		explosions that resulted when water from a melting glacier met molten lava shattered the cooled, solidified lava into tiny knife-edged shards. Although 		less than 2% by weight of ash particles spewed during a typical eruption measure less than 10 micrometers across, more than 20% by weight of 		Eyjafjallajökull's early-stage ash fell below this unhealthful threshold. This powdery ash is particularly susceptible to melting quickly inside a 		jet engine, the researchers note. It can also be readily breathed deep into the lungs of humans living downwind of the volcano. 	 		The sharp edges on Eyjafjallajökull's ash particles didn't wear away even when large numbers of ash particles were swirled in a beaker of water 		for 2 weeks, a sign, Stipp says, that the powdery ash could have remained a risk to aviation as long as it remained airborne. 	 		The new research "is a very nice piece of work," says Kirk Nordstrom, a hydrogeochemist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado. "These 		particles are particularly abrasive, and they have more ability to damage aircraft than most people realize." 	 		Moreover, Eyjafjallajökull's early-stage ash boasted a greater surface area upon which noxious constituents of the volcanic plume--including 		fluorine, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide--could attach. The team's lab tests suggest that the powdery ash had about 10 times the area found on a 		similar-sized sample of typical ash. Although most scientists presume that those harmful gases are concentrated near the volcano, the new findings hint 		that in some cases, particularly when glacial meltwater interacts with lava to produce exceptionally fine ash, the hazards could be transported long 		distances, Nordstrom says. 	 		Stipp and her colleagues suggest that ash falls from this eruption weren't a large threat to Europe, but the ones in Iceland were certainly hazardous 		to humans and to grazing animals that might have ingested substantial amounts of the sharp-edged grit.

However, it’s unlikely that any of the proposals the president advances will move us closer to a policy breakthrough. It’s more likely the president will propose ideas that make our immigration system less effective and do little to keep us safe.The Trump administration’s solutions on immigration have so far only created more problems at the southern border, in the immigration courts, and for our legal immigration system.The president has been insisting on $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, claiming that a physical barrier would prevent migrants from crossing into the United States without authorization.But building more fencing is costly and unnecessary. Extensive barriers on the border already exist. They have done little to impede illegal border crossings. A wall will also not stop drugs from being smuggled into the United States, as most come through legal ports of entry.Instead of a wall, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents say additional border security technology would be more helpful. This includes drones, sensors for ports of entry, and other surveillance systems. Congressional Democrats offered more technology like this in recent negotiations on border security.The United States has a well-established asylum system. Yet the administration has repeatedly tried to dismantle that system and create deadly barriers for asylum seekers fleeing to the United States.The administration’s attacks on asylum have been wide-ranging. Asylum seekers have been illegally turned away at the border, separated from their families, and denied access to the asylum process. Some are being forced to wait for their court dates on the Mexico side of the border despite the well-known dangers. Changes to asylum law have also disqualified many from receiving protections.This puts vulnerable people in dangerous situations and curtails their access to counsel. The solution to this self-made problem is simple—Trump should allow people to access our established asylum system so they can be vetted for protection in a safe and timely way. To make this a reality, there must be meaningful oversight of CBP and their handling of asylum seekers at the border. We can also complement protection at the border by increasing refugee admissions from abroad.Under the current administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abandoned their pre-existing enforcement priorities. Instead of targeting immigrants who present a risk to public safety, the agency began arresting anyone in the United States without legal status.ICE arrested nearly a third more immigrants who had no criminal history in 2018 than in 2017. They have also placed more people who have resided in the United States for long periods of times in removal proceedings. More expansive enforcement has devastated communities, as deported parents often have no choice but to leave behind their U.S.-citizen children and local economies suffered after immigrant workers were arrested.A return to common-sense enforcement priorities would cause far less damage for families and communities and use limited resources more effectively.The administration is also cutting legal immigration. These cuts are hurting the United States’ standing as a global competitor and causing worker shortages across the nation.This has included changes to employment visas and policies that could bar foreign students and exchange visitors from coming to the United States. The administration even proposed a complete overhaul of the U.S. immigration system that would cut legal immigration in half.The United States needs to remain a welcoming place for foreign talent. Rather than finding ways to slash legal immigration, the president needs to embrace it so our country does not fall behind.President Trump’s harsh vision for immigration is increasingly out of step with what’s in the best interest of the nation. The state of the union would indeed be stronger if the president offered productive, bipartisan solutions that make America a more welcoming and prosperous country.Tags:  Customs and Border Protection, Donald Trump, featured, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, State of the UnionIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.  Immigration ImpactSpeaking before Congress and the nation Tuesday evening, President Trump once again promised bipartisanship and instead delivered division. When it came to immigration, the president neither offered an olive branch nor acknowledged the devastating effects of his administration’s actions to date. Rather than offer solutions to the actual problems facing immigrants across the country, his speech reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of the state of immigration.Despite President Trump’s claims about border insecurity, the border is in fact safer and more secure than at any point in history. In the past two years, the number of people apprehended at the U.S-Mexico border has dropped to levels not seen since the 1970s. At the same time, the Border Patrol now estimates that it detects more than 90 percent of all attempts to cross the border.In addition, an increase in the arrival of families seeking asylum means that increasingly large numbers of asylum-seekers cross the border and then politely turn themselves in to the nearest Border Patrol officer. These families are not seeking to evade capture nor pose a threat to anyone; they are seeking access to the humanitarian protections that are at the foundation of American values.To the extent that there is a crisis at the border, it is one manufactured by the Trump administration. Rather than address the rising number of families by increasing capacity to process asylum seekers, the government has unveiled policy after policy seeking to stop people from coming in the first place. Some of those policies—like family separation or the ban on allowing asylum seekers to apply if they crossed between the ports of entry—have been halted by courts. Others, like the dangerous new policy forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while they go through the court process, are just now going into effect. By focusing on deterrence instead of solutions, the administration has fueled a growing humanitarian disaster at the border.Trump continued to vilify individuals in the United States without status and painted compassion towards undocumented immigrants as a slight towards the native-born. But decades of research show that undocumented immigrants play a vital and important role in making this country great. Millions of undocumented immigrants pay taxes each year through the use of an Individual Tax Identification Number. In addition, undocumented immigrants pay over $10 billion each year into Social Security despite not being eligible to draw from those funds.Far from hurting American workers, there is little competition between the unemployment rate and the presence of recent immigrants of all types. Instead, the presence of both documented and undocumented immigrants helps build America’s economic growth.In 2018, Trump built much of his State of the Union speech around a call for his “four pillars” of immigration reform, one of which involved cutting legal immigration levels in half by eliminating family-based immigration.This year, Trump deviated from his prepared speech and stated that “I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever.” Unfortunately, over the past year his administration has worked harder than ever to cut legal immigration and make it more difficult to come to the United States.A recent analysis shows that processing delays at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have reached “crisis levels,” slowing down the legal immigration process for everyone. The administration is also seeking to redefine the legal term “public charge” to block green cards for low-income immigrants, an action which could further slash legal immigration. Refugee admissions have also been cut to their lowest levels ever.When people come together to address the actual immigration issues facing this country, they can agree on common-sense solutions. Polls show that 81 percent of Americans agree that undocumented immigrants should be given a path to citizenship. From decreasing the use of detention to providing a permanent path to status for DREAMers and those with Temporary Protected Status, there are bipartisan solutions that exist if only the president would acknowledge them.If Congress wants to achieve true immigration reform, it must acknowledge the actual state of immigration and not the dark tale presented by the president.Photo by the White HouseTags:  Donald Trump, featured, State of the Union, U.S.-Mexico Border, USCISIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.  Immigration ImpactPresident Trump went in front of the public on Saturday and claimed he was going to propose a “compromise” to end the ongoing government shutdown. Instead of offering a bipartisan bill that would protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients from deportation, the 1300-page bill unveiled Monday night was loaded with broad attacks on protections for children and asylum seekers.Calling these provisions “a poison pill,” Democratic leaders swiftly denounced the plan, indicating that the “compromise” bill was dead on arrival.In exchange for massive restrictions on asylum and the gutting of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for future beneficiaries, the Trump administration is only offering short-term “fixes.” This includes a costly, difficult-to-obtain temporary reprieve for individuals with DACA and current TPS holders from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti. This new status, “provisional protected presence,” would apply for three years and then expire. There is no path to citizenship.Aside from being temporary, the proposed status outlined in the bill would likely do little for those with DACA or TPS, as the administration’s attempts to end both of these protections have so far mostly failed.On Tuesday morning, the Supreme Court remained silent about whether they would take up a request to hear a case challenging the elimination of DACA. Even if the Court later decides to hear the case, arguments would not be until at least the fall of 2019. As a result, DACA beneficiaries will be able to renew their status through at least this year, which may reduce pressure on including DACA protections in a near-term budget compromise. Similarly, many TPS holders whose status was terminated by the administration remain protected due to court actions.The bill unveiled on Monday, called the BRIDGE Act (despite bearing little resemblance to a previous bipartisan bill bearing the same name), limits new protections only to those who currently have DACA, or those who have TPS from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Haiti. However, the bill imposes additional restrictions that would prevent many from being eligible for the new status, including some who are already DACA and TPS recipients.Among these restrictions are a series of financial burdens designed to make it hard for low-income recipients to qualify for the new status. In order to qualify, DACA and TPS recipients would have to satisfy a higher burden of proof for eligibility, prove that they would be able to maintain an income no less than 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, and in some cases would have to repay refundable tax credits that they had lawfully received.In exchange for this extremely limited and expensive new status, the bill includes the president’s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall, along with an increase in ICE detention to 52,000 beds and money for additional Border Patrol and ICE agents.The bill also includes a series of poison pill amendments which strip asylum eligibility from children from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Those children would be rendered ineligible for asylum unless they go through a new application process that requires them to apply in their home countries or in other Central American countries.Under this new process, only 50,000 applications would be accepted each year, and only 15,000 asylum grants would be permitted. Children would also have to prove they have a “qualified parent or guardian” in the United States to establish eligibility.In addition to these and other major restrictions on asylum for children, the bill proposes a series of changes to asylum applications in general. For example, asylum applications could be deemed “frivolous” if the applicant “in whole or in part” requests asylum in order to obtain work authorization, which many applicants need to do to support themselves while they await a decision.The bill also further limits humanitarian protections by gutting the future of TPS by limiting it only to individuals “lawfully present” in the United States when a disaster or conflict strikes their home country. This loses sight of the original purpose of TPS—to provide temporary safe haven to people in the United States based on a discreet need for protection, regardless of immigration status.Despite the president’s claim that this bill was a “compromise,” the devil was indeed in the details. It’s a laundry list of attacks on critical protections for children, asylum seekers, and those fleeing disasters. It is not a serious attempt at finding common ground. Given the bill’s chilly reception, any hopes that it would be the vehicle to end the shutdown seems highly unlikely.Tags:  BRIDGE Act, Donald Trump, El Salvador, featured, Haiti, HondurasIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.  Immigration ImpactA federal judge blocked the Trump administration’s plan to add a question on U.S. citizenship to the 2020 Census on Tuesday, ruling that the controversial move “violated the public trust” and would be damaging to immigrants.Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced the administration’s intention to add the question – “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” to the Census back in March 2018.Plans to move forward with the new question became quickly tied up in various legal battles, as many feared it would decrease participation in the Census among immigrants. Six former Census Bureau directors also came out in opposition of a citizenship question.In his 277-page ruling, Judge Jesse Furman determined that the secretary had exceeded his authority and the addition had not undergone the rigorous testing required of all new Census questions. Furman also ruled that Ross had concealed “his real reason” for adding the question in the first place.Ross reportedly drafted the question after consulting with former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and politician Kris Kobach, all known for their anti-immigrant views.Including such a question would damage immigrant communities, both advocates and the judge argued. This would be particularly true among noncitizen households.Manipulating the 2020 Census—which will be used to determine electoral college votes in U.S. elections, congressional seats, and federal funding for the next 10 years—would have a lasting impact on political representation.The Court found that a decline in self-response rates among noncitizens households would “cause several jurisdictions to lose seats in the next congressional apportionment and that it will cause another set of jurisdictions to lose political representation in the next round of intrastate redistricting.”Losing that political power would essentially strip already underrepresented communities of key representation and resources. Population Reference Bureau estimates that up to one in 10 U.S. households—or 45 million people—would be at risk of not being counted if a citizenship question is asked.The Trump administration has not announced how it will respond to the judgement, but the government could appeal or move the case directly to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court decides to take up the full case, then it could be heard in the spring.As it stands, however, Judge Furman’s ruling is a welcome victory for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the Census.Tags:  citizenship, Donald Trump, featured, Supreme CourtIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.  Immigration ImpactIn recent months, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has methodically ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for six countries, including over 300,000 people from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. Newly revealed State Department cables now confirm that the Trump administration’s interest in ending these designations superseded stark warnings from U.S. embassies on the ground about the destabilizing effects these terminations would have on a region already plagued by violence and other challenges.The Washington Post reported on an investigation conducted by members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee into how decisions were made to terminate TPS for El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti. State Department cables reportedly included strong opposition to ending TPS, which was overruled without justification in the formal recommendation to DHS by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ), ranking member of the committee, referred to Tillerson’s position as the “deliberate disregard” of the expertise of career diplomats.U.S. law requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult with other government agencies prior to making a decision about extending or terminating a TPS designation. The consultative process is designed to ensure that there is a thorough review of conditions in the foreign country to determine whether a TPS designation is still warranted. Designations can be based on ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. The purpose of TPS is to ensure that the U.S. government is not deporting people to a country that is unsafe or unable to absorb them if conditions there have become seriously problematic.Many observers and advocates have been questioning how the Trump administration was approaching these TPS decisions and sought to challenge the decision-making process in court.In response to the termination of TPS for Haiti in November 2018, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a lawsuit, arguing that the deviation from the normal decision making process was “irrational and discriminatory” and guided by the administration’s “public hostility toward immigrants of color.” A separate challenge to the termination of TPS for El Salvador argued that “the termination was based not on a reasoned consideration of country conditions… but rather motivated by racial animus….”Plaintiffs in yet another lawsuit challenging the termination of TPS for Haiti obtained documents that shed light on the problematic termination recommendation made by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Francis Cissna to the DHS Secretary. Despite his conclusions that “Haiti has made significant progress in recovering from the 2010 earthquake, and no longer continues to meet the conditions for designation,” the internal government report he relied on to support his recommendation made clear that Haiti continued “to be affected by a convergence of humanitarian needs including food insecurity, internal displacement, an influx of returnees from the Dominican Republic, the persistence of cholera, and the lingering impact of various natural disasters.”Although it’s unlikely that DHS will revisit the decisions to terminate so many TPS designations in light of these revelations, they are a stark reminder that over 300,000 TPS beneficiaries may face being deported to risky, unsafe, and extremely difficult countries they left long ago. For example, more than half of TPS beneficiaries from El Salvador and Haiti have lived in the United States for over twenty years.The U.S. government’s decision to end their status and deport them should not be taken lightly. DHS has an obligation to make sound decisions based on the facts, especially when people’s lives are at stake.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, Donald Trump, featured, U.S. State DepartmentIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.  Immigration ImpactThe Trump administration has slowed the processing of immigration benefit applications to a crawl, causing needless harm to immigrants, their families, and their employers. Under President Trump, the backlog of applications at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) doubled in the span of only one year.A recent analysis of USCIS data by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) refers to these “crisis-level delays”  as “bricks in the Trump administration’s ‘invisible wall’ curbing legal immigration in the United States.”The numbers bear this out. According to AILA’s analysis, the average case processing time for all application types has increased 46 percent since Fiscal Year (FY) 2016—the last full fiscal year of the Obama administration. These escalating delays have occurred even when the number of new applications has fallen. For instance, from FY 2017 to 2018, processing times increased by 19 percent even though receipts of new applications declined 17 percent. So the delays cannot be plausibly blamed on rising workload.In fact, this state of affairs is exactly the opposite of what USCIS was intended to do. When USCIS was created in 2002, elimination of application backlogs—and prevention of future backlogs—were explicit priorities of the new agency. USCIS was meant to be an agency that provided immigration benefits to customers; it was not intended to function like an enforcement agency.But the tables have turned in the Trump era, with the institution of new security protocols that needlessly drag out the processing of virtually every application. For instance, in-person interviews are now required for each and every employment-based green card applicant. The administration’s overhaul of the refugee program has also brought processing of many cases to a complete standstill.From FY 2017 to FY 2018, the processing time of an N-400 (Application for Naturalization) rose from 8 months to over 10. Processing an I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) went from 8 to 11 months. And the processing time of an I-765 (Application for Work Authorization) rose from 3 to 4 months.Delays of this magnitude have serious repercussions when people can’t get a job, join their families, or escape refugee camps. The report cautions:“Longer processing times mean families struggle to make ends meet, survivors of violence and torture face danger, and U.S. companies fall behind.”The report suggests USCIS should begin providing service to its customers again rather than approaching everyone as a security risk. It also urges Congress to exercise some oversight authority over the agency, which has been sorely lacking during the past two years. Finally, USCIS operations should be made more transparent to the public so it is clear why applications take so long to process.USCIS processing delays and application backlogs under the Trump administration are having a devastating impact on the legal immigration system. This, in turn, is having an unnecessarily negative effect on families and employers across the country.Tags:  Donald Trump, featured, processing times, USCISIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.  Immigration ImpactThe Trump administration on Friday sent nine so-called sanctuary jurisdictions letters demanding they help enforce federal immigration law or risk losing federal grants.“Failure to comply with this condition could result in the withholding of grant funds, suspension or termination of the grant, ineligibility for future [Office of Justice] grants or subgrants, or other action, as appropriate,” acting Assistant Attorney General Alan R. Harten wrote in letters to local officials.Harten’s letter said the jurisdictions must submit documentation showing that they are in compliance with federal law. Sanctuary cities refuse to assist federal agencies with immigration enforcement. The jurisdictions included New York City, Chicago and the surrounding Cook County, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Miami-Dade County in Florida and the state of California, which were all identified in a May 2016 Justice Department inspector general report as in violation. The report said the jurisdictions have local rules or regulations that interfere with local law enforcement's ability to share information with federal authorities about the immigration status of people in custody.The Justice Department release sent out along with the letter described the sanctuary jurisdictions targeted as "crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime."Attorney General Jeff SessionsJefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsTrump: Some statements about him in Mueller report are 'total bulls---' Colbert hits Trump after Mueller report: Innocent people don't say 'I'm f---ed' The Hill's Morning Report — Mueller aftermath: What will House Dems do now?

It's a contentious issue, considering the border wall would cost billions of dollars.    On Thursday, Trump threatened to cancel a meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, after Peña Nieto reiterated that Mexico would not pay for it.   On Thursday, Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, said Congress will follow through on Trump's border wall order, and McConnell estimated it will cost $15 billion at most — he cited a range of $12 billion to $15 billion.    The U.S. border with Mexico is roughly 2,000 miles long and underlines four states, from California to Texas, more than half of it along the Colorado River and Rio Grande. It is a massive stretch of land — the Berlin Wall spanned just 96 miles comparatively, and it cost about $25 million to build in 1961, or around $200 million with inflation.    Building a wall to keep out illegal immigrants is not a novel plan. About 670 miles of fencing on the U.S.–Mexico border was completed in accordance with the Bush administration's Secure Fence Act of 2006. That alone cost about $2.4 billion, for roughly one-third of the entire border and, according to migration experts, some of the easier and less costly areas to fence.    The Secure Fence Act called for 700 miles of fencing, with a double layer throughout, but much of the barrier isn't reinforced this way. Even before the fence reached its first stage of completion, some argued it was not being constructed properly.    "It's a lot more expensive than we expected when we started, and it was much more difficult," said Ronald Vitiello, deputy chief of border patrol for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, at a Senate Committee hearing in May 2015.   Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a January 2015 statement to right-leaning publication Daily Caller (founded by Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson and former Dick Cheney advisor Neil Patel) that "in our conversations with outside groups, experts and stakeholders, we learned that it would be an inefficient use of taxpayer money to complete the fence. … We are using that money to utilize other technology to create a secure border."    On the campaign trail Trump's immigration reform plan called for impounding remittance payments derived from illegal wages, a controversial idea, and imposing increased visa and entry fees to the United States from Mexico unless the latter agrees to finance the wall. Trump is also pushing border taxes more broadly against trading partners, which could help finance the wall. According to a Government Accountability Office 2009 report, the cost to build 1 mile of fencing at the border averaged between $2.8 million and $3.9 million. But that figure may be low relative to costs for future sections of the wall. It's based only on the first 220 miles fenced and does not include other factors, such as topography, transportation logistics in harder-to-reach areas (i.e. road-building and earth and drainage work), labor costs, land acquisition costs and surveillance equipment.   "The first miles of fencing were in the easiest" places, said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. These were fencing areas in or close to cities and accessible transportation, rather than deep in deserts or mountains. Additionally, the first miles were on public lands, while completing a border wall would require the government to acquire land from private holders. The GAO estimate for one difficult section of fencing near San Diego was $16 million.   One aspect of the wall debate more important than the cost is its worth. The migration expert Rosenblum said fencing in remote areas of the United States isn't likely to achieve the goal of a more secure border.    "It's not necessary to have a pedestrian fence in places where the infrastructure doesn't support people walking toward the border," Vitiello said in his May Senate testimony.    Trump's Department of Homeland Security chief, John Kelly, said in recent Senate testimony, a "physical barrier will not do the job." He went on to say it can be part of a strategy. "If you build a wall, you would still have to back that wall up with patrolling by human beings, by sensors, by observation devices."   Border walls work in densely populated areas — such as Israel's wall in the West Bank — where slowing down a person trying to illegally enter by five or 10 minutes can make a difference to border patrol. But when the migrant trying to enter is traveling over remote mountains and deserts for three days, using a fence to slow them down by a few minutes doesn't have the same effect — it borders on the trivial, Rosenblum said.   "There is a reason people don't build fences in the middle of nowhere; it doesn't change the enforcement profile in the middle of nowhere," the migration expert said. "The existing fence has worked because of where it is, near populated areas. Both Democrats and Republicans have testified that they have the fencing they need," Rosenblum said.     The actual cost for the rest of the border wall (roughly 1,300 miles) could be as high as $16 million per mile, with a total price tag of $15 billion to $25 billion. Rosenblum said the $15 billion low-end estimate is "probably an underestimate," because the parts that have yet to be fenced are the most difficult — the most dense and arid. At $16 million per mile and with 1,300 miles to secure, the estimated cost would be $12 billion, and the price of private land acquisitions and maintenance of fencing could push that total cost higher.   The U.S. government would have to pay to maintain the wall, which could cost as much as $750 million a year, according to an analysis conducted by Politico. And then if it wanted to man it with personnel, that would be an additional cost — border patrol has an operating budget of $1.4 billion for 21,000 agents.    "The need to maintain, repair and replace outdated and aging fencing will continue to be an issue," Vitiello said during his Senate testimony given in May.   In addition to the 2009 GAO estimate of price per mile, more recent spending data is now available from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). From fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2014, $5.9 billion in total appropriations was awarded by Congress to the Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology Account (BSFIT). The account covers fencing, along with associated infrastructure, including roads to install and maintain fencing and cameras to monitor fencing.    "This is actually the best way to think about the real costs of installing/maintaining fencing," Rosenblum said. "A fence is useless without a camera to tell you when someone has climbed over it."   From fiscal 2007 (when the U.S Customs and Border Protection BSFIT account was created) through fiscal 2014, the Department of Homeland Security installed and maintained 512 miles of fencing, on top of 140 previously existing miles. If all of the $5.9 billion went to new installation, the rate per mile would be $11.5 million. If spread out to cover the full 652 miles, the estimate would be $9 million/mile.    Rosenblum said most of the BSFIT money and fence installation occurred between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2010. During that period, DHS installed 507 miles of new fencing, with $4.5 billion appropriated to the BSFIT account. If all the money went to new fencing during this period, the price per mile would be $8.9 million. While there is a discrepancy between the BSFIT high-end estimate ($11.5 million/mile) and earlier GAO estimate ($16.6 million/mile), Rosenblum said that, in the least, the higher numbers from both agencies are more relevant to the sections of border fencing still to be built than the GAO estimate for the initial sections at between $2.8 million and $3.9 million.  "The cost of building a permanent border wall pales mightily in comparison to what American taxpayers spend every single year on dealing with the fallout of illegal immigration on their communities, schools and unemployment offices," according to Trump's website, though it doesn't put an actual figure on either expense.    There's one more aspect to Trump's plan that could make it even costlier — he is talking about a wall, not a fence. If he really means what he says, "the price would go up quite a bit," Rosenblum said. The existing border "wall" is actually fencing and, in some areas, not even fencing but vehicular barriers.    —By Kate Drew, special to CNBC.com Got a confidential news tip?

Judd is head of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing more than 16,000 agents.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Let's get some insight into what President-elect Trump might really mean by his pledge to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. That pledge won him many, many supporters, including Border Patrol agent Brandon Judd, who sees the wall as part of a wider security strategy.BRANDON JUDD: We're excited that we're going to be able to do our job. Under the Obama administration, law enforcement were being handcuffed and the criminals were being let go.INSKEEP: Judd contends the Border Patrol hasn't been holding all the people it catches crossing the border. Judd leads a union, the National Border Patrol Council, which endorsed Trump and has advised the transition team. Trump initially said his wall would stretch the length of the whole border - more than 1,900 miles - which loom very large in the public imagination, though he has since said the wall could be smaller.JUDD: The wall is going to be absolutely effective in certain locations. We do not need a wall along the entire 2,000 miles of border. And what I really appreciate about President-elect Trump is he understands that he doesn't know everything. And every single time that I've sat down and spoken with him, we've talked about a wall. We've talked about whether it needs to be the full 2,000 miles of the Southwest border or if we just need it in strategic locations. And he's been willing to listen and that's very refreshing.INSKEEP: I guess we should remember there are already walls, as well as fences along hundreds of miles of the border. And when you say strategic locations, you put those barriers in places that are easy to cross and in other places you let the harsh landscape do the job for you. Is that right?JUDD: That is correct.INSKEEP: And so you would continue with that strategy, maybe just with a little more construction?JUDD: That is correct. Right now, we only have fencing along approximately 10 to 15 percent of the border right now. We have breaches in those walls all the time. In fact, in Douglas over the weekend, four vehicles drove through a hole that smugglers cut in the Landing Mat fence. And all four vehicles were able to evade detection or apprehension.INSKEEP: And I'm trying to remember, that's a place where you've got steel bar fencing that's, I don't know, eight, 10, 12 feet high, something like that?JUDD: Yeah. They were able to cut the fence with a welding torch, drive the vehicles through. And then they closed the hole back up to where it's very, very difficult to detect.INSKEEP: It sounds to me like what you are hoping comes out of this administration is relatively subtle compared to the rhetoric of the campaign. You'd like some more people to be detained rather than let go. You'd like some more construction on the border where there's already a lot of construction. You want tweaks to the big policy, rather than a gigantic wall or some gigantic sea change.JUDD: Well, we do want walls in certain locations. We do want a very effective wall. We're not talking about a brick-and-mortar wall. If you build just a brick-and-mortar wall, they're going to come up and they're going to break that wall down. And then it's going to be very, very hard to patch that type wall. You have to build something that is going to be very difficult to defeat.INSKEEP: Is there a danger in trying to increase border security without changing the incentives? I mean, there are incentives because people need work and they come to the United States for work. And there's not always an easy and legal way for them to get here and do that work.JUDD: It all goes hand-in-hand. But it all starts with securing the border. If individuals cannot come into the United States illegally, then you can deal with those people that are here. You can't put the cart before the horse, otherwise we're going to be in the same situation that we're in today a few years down the road. Secure the border first, then worry about those individuals that are here illegally.INSKEEP: So what does secure the border mean to you? Does it mean not a single person ever gets across?JUDD: It does.INSKEEP: So in your mind, the border is not secure until illegal immigration is zero?JUDD: It is.INSKEEP: Does that mean the border is never actually secure by that definition?JUDD: No. The border absolutely can be secured. I guarantee that we can secure the border to where we apprehend 100 percent of the individuals that cross illegally.INSKEEP: I mean, people got across the Berlin Wall. You know, people are pretty innovative.JUDD: And we also can be innovative. That one of the problems that we face is the cartels that we're up against, the cartels that we're dealing with, they're constantly evolving - we don't. If we integrate intelligence strategy to combat the cartels, we absolutely can be effective - 100 percent effective. We've never tried it.INSKEEP: Just so that I'm clear on what is proposed and what the timeline is, as best you understand it from the president-elect, if there's not going to be 2,000 miles of wall, how many miles are there going to be?JUDD: In fact, I was in discussions with the transition team yesterday. If you were to ask me, I would say that we - right now, again, we have about 10 to 15 percent of our border has a - has an actual fence. If I were to quantify an actual number, I would say that we need about 30 percent. Thirty percent of our border has to have an actual fence, comma wall.INSKEEP: I'm just going to go with your numbers here. You're saying that there is somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple hundred miles of serious fencing right now, and you'd like to see 400 miles with more serious barriers.JUDD: Approximately, yes.INSKEEP: That's about what we're talking about. This whole debate has been about a couple of hundred miles of fence?JUDD: Not the whole debate. The debate's about border security. That's what the debate is about. How can you possibly say that the whole debate has been about a couple hundred miles of wall?INSKEEP: I'm asking. I'm asking. I'm just - I think some people will be...JUDD: No. The debate...INSKEEP: ...It looms so large that I think some people will be surprised that...JUDD: OK. But the point is - and the point that the President-elect Trump has always been making is that the border is not secure period, it's not secure. How can you consider a border in which agents apprehend one out of every two people that cross the border? Fifty percent, that is not a secure border.INSKEEP: How soon has Trump or his transition team told you that the border will be secure?JUDD: They haven't. They're looking at that right now, but there's a lot that has to go into building the fence and wall. But I guarantee it will be done within his administration.INSKEEP: Brandon Judd, thanks very much, really appreciate it.JUDD: No problem, appreciate it.INSKEEP: He's president of the National Border Patrol Council, a union.Copyright © 2016 NPR.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsorPresident Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday in response to public outcry about family separation – a horrific policy that has led to the forced separation of over 2,000 minor children from their parents. Though the order discusses an end to the callous form of family separation that has captured the nation’s attention in recent weeks, it does not end all forms of family separation and will ramp up family detention, an insidious alternative.By Thursday, much has remained unclear about how the order will be implemented. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), for example, have offered conflicting statements regarding whether parents arriving with their children will continue to be prosecuted under Trump’s “zero-tolerance” policy.Here is what we do know. Yesterday’s order permits DHS to imprison mothers and possibly also fathers with their minor children together in existing family detention centers – in Dilley, Karnes, and Berks – in addition to one of several military bases that have been proposed by the government. Apart from the fact that a military base is not an appropriate setting for vulnerable asylum seekers who have just endured a perilous journey to the United States – and certainly not for children – at least one of the proposed sites is located in a remote location, hours from the nearest large metropolitan center. This would keep asylum seekers far from pro bono attorneys and experts who can help them win their cases.The order offers no recourse to the over 2,300 children who have been ripped from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in the past several weeks. Many parents – who were criminally prosecuted shortly after crossing the border – have since been deported from the United States, without their children.Many parents have reported that they have not been given any information about their children’s whereabouts. The Trump administration has a logistical nightmare on its hands and does not appear to be taking any meaningful steps to address it.Even further, the Washington Post is reporting that the Border Patrol announced it would stop referring parents arriving with their children for prosecution until DHS can find additional detention space. DOJ immediately attempted to clarify stating that the “zero tolerance” policy, where DOJ prosecutes all unauthorized border crossers referred to them for the crime of unlawful entry by DHS, remains in place. It is possible both statements are correct because DOJ cannot prosecute someone unless the person is referred to DOJ, but this will likely be clarified in the coming days.Wednesday’s order will soon run into legal problems as the White House does not have the power to unilaterally dismantle the Flores Settlement Agreement, a 30-year old legal agreement which governs the detention and treatment of immigrant children held in government custody.The Flores Agreement requires that immigrant children be released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody – preferably to a parent – without delay; when that child can’t be released due to a significant public safety or flight risk concern, the child should be placed in the least restrictive setting in a non-secure facility licensed by a child welfare entity.  None of the three existing family detention facilities currently operating in the United States – in Dilley, Texas, Karnes City, Texas, and in Berks County, Pennsylvania – are licensed by a child welfare entity; all of them are “secure.”The government has asked a federal court to alter the Flores Agreement in fundamental ways – to allow children to be detained by ICE throughout their parents’ entire criminal and immigration proceedings; and to exempt ICE family detention facilities from state licensing requirements.Rolling back these Flores protections – though unlikely – would strip away meaningful legal protections and could lead to indefinite detention of immigrant children.These family detention centers – recently termed “babyjails” by a member of Congress – are tantamount to prisons, where the families are not permitted to leave and have limited access to medical and mental health care.In the coming days and weeks, more of this will unfold. Even if the government stops its policy of prosecuting parents at the U.S.-Mexico border and separating the parents from their children, the practice of imprisoning larger numbers of asylum-seeking families is no better. This administration must cease its unrelenting attack on immigrant families.Tags:  Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Family Detention, family separation, featured, FloresIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe now to receive more just like it.  Immigration ImpactThe children are separated from their parents — or, to be precise, from the adults accompanying them, who may or may not be their parents — when their parents cross the southern U.S. border illegally and are caught and detained.Previously, under the “catch-and-release” policy, the adults would be released. Under the “zero tolerance” policy of the Trump administration, the adults are being detained and prosecuted. Children cannot be incarcerated with them.However, families that arrive together at legal ports of entry and apply for asylum status are generally not split up and are permitted to stay in the U.S. pending the adjudication of their applications (which can take several years).Democrats and the mainstream media have accused the administration of separating the children of “immigrants” from their parents and imprisoning them in “cages.” On Thursday, CNN analyst and Playboy reporter Brian Karem shouted at White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: “These people have nothing. They come to the border with nothing and you throw children in cages.” None of the reporters in the briefing room corrected him.The facility at El Cajon, however, is not a “cage.” It is a comfortable facility providing lodging, meals, clothing, medical care, education, recreation, counseling, and other services.It is run by a nonprofit organization called Southwest Key as part of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Program, run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in the Administration for Children and Familes (ACF).The facility is located on a main street in a quiet, suburban neighborhood. It has 65 beds, occupied by boys ages 6 to 17. The rooms are spare, with three to four beds in each; the boys are responsible for cleaning the rooms and making their own beds. There is an outdoor recreation area with picnic tables and a small soccer pitch.There is a classroom area, and English lessons. The goal is “reunification”: letting each child depart with a legal guardian.Some 90% of the children at the shelter arrived at the border without adults; the other 10% were separated from the adults accompanying them. Once the children arrive — usually brought by U.S. Border Patrol agents — they are greeted in the “intake” office, where they receive any urgent medical care, are assigned a case worker, and are given food, a shower, and new clothing. They are also given toiletries and lessons in hygiene — literally how to flush a toilet, brush their teeth, and operate the shower, which some of the children may have never seen in their lives.The children receive six hours of education daily, which include lessons in English and physical education. The boys interact with girls who are housed offsite and brought to the shelter during the day to access its services.They have limited access to telephones to call relatives, both in the U.S. and abroad. They receive therapy, both as individuals and in group sessions. They enjoy field trips to local museums, parks, and the zoo, where they can explore the city beyond the shelter. And they also have social activities, including a recent “prom” for which they dressed up.“Cages,” these are not. What is immediately striking about the facility is the enthusiasm and care of the staff who work there. One administrator greeted the journalists on the tour: “Welcome to our home.” The children at the facility seemed genuinely happy, despite their unfortunate circumstances and the trauma of their long journey.The real scandal is how the media have portrayed the shelters. When MSNBC’s Jacob Soboroff toured a similar facility this week in Brownsville, Texas, for example, he referred to the children there as being “incarcerated,” which is only true in the same sense that hospital patients, too, are not permitted to leave, for their safety. (One official who had seen Soboroff’s televised report accused him of “flat-out lying” about the facility — such as, for example, reporting on a mural of Donald Trump without noting 19 other presidents were similarly depicted.)Southwest Key has operated its facilities — 27 in total, across California, Arizona, and Texas — since 1997, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Flores v. Reno that unaccompanied illegal alien minors could not be held in detention facilities. This is not a new problem, even though it took Trump to make the media realize it existed.Update: HSS provided a video of the visit:Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

                    By JOSH GERSTEIN06/29/2018 09:41 PM EDT
                    Updated 06/30/2018 08:32 AM EDTJust days after President Donald Trump announced that his administration would ask a federal court to permit detention of immigrant families by modifying a longstanding court settlement, Justice Department lawyers told the Los Angeles-based judge handling the case Friday that no change to the decree may be needed. Trump administration lawyers argued that a separate injunction a federal judge in San Diego issued Tuesday barring family separations effectively wipes out provisions in the decades-old Flores agreement that have been determined to bar detention of most children in immigration custody for more than 20 days.Story Continued Below “The rulings work together to permit detention of parents with their minor children with whom they are apprehended,” Justice Department attorneys wrote in a submission to U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who oversees the 31-year-old Flores agreement on the treatment of immigrant children. The filing appears to leave open one key question: What becomes of the Flores agreement's requirement that children be held in state-licensed day care facilities?  Federal authorities say a family detention center in Pennsylvania has such approvals, but two other centers in Texas do not. In addition, federal officials are crafting plans to hold some families in makeshift centers yet to be constructed on military bases, which don't have such approval and may not be able to get it anytime soon.Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The government's filing Friday treats that issue in a footnote, but it could become a major sticking point. “The issue regarding how the Flores Agreement licensing provisions apply to family detention centers is the subject of ongoing litigation,” Justice Department attorneys wrote. “We have also asked this Court to modify the Agreement to permit the transfer of families together to family residential centers without requiring a state license.” Thorny questions also remain about parents’ rights under the two court orders. The government notes that the injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw suggests that keeping families together is the default position, with parents permitted to agree to release of a child to another family member. However, lawyers advocating for children under the Flores agreement have typically he issue differently, saying that a child should be placed in the community unless parents affirmatively agree to them remaining in detention.“The Trump Administration has been engaged — since January of 2017–in restoring order to the lawlessness at the southwest border and protecting our nation’s citizens, but we are beholden to a broken immigration system that Congress has refused to fix and that courts have exacerbated,” a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement. “While Congress has recessed for the 4th of July holiday, we continue to urge them to act decisively in order to solve the crisis at our border and end ‘catch and release.’”The Justice Department's position gives supremacy to the injunction Sabraw issued Tuesday, while the decades-old Flores agreement oriented toward release of children has been interpreted by not only Gee but the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to require release of accompanied and unaccompanied minors within 20 days. 
Congress
                    By ELANA SCHOR Immigration advocates in both cases have suggested parents should have a right to opt to keep their families together, but no court has specifically endorsed a right to opt-out of Flores' release requirements. Despite the government's position that the current state of play in the two legal cases allows the detention of immigrant families, Justice Department lawyers said in their pleading Friday that the government continues "to believe that an amendment to the agreement is appropriate to address this issue." Late Friday night, immigrant rights advocates involved in the Flores case responded to the government's submission last week asking Gee to end the consent decree's provisions requiring release of immigrant children. No change to the pact is needed, the lawyers pressing the class-action case said."Modifying the agreement to strip accompanied class members of the right to reasonably prompt release would not improve Defendants’ ability to keep families together. It would permit Defendants to force families to stay together in unlicensed facilities by eliminating class members’ right – subject to opt out by a parent – to be released or placed under the terms of the Agreement," the immigrant children's attorneys wrote.The immigrant rights' lawyers also dispute the Trump administration's claims that it is facing a massive surge of family migration. They say a recent inspection by one of their lawyers found the 2,400-bed Dilley, Texas, family detention facility to have more than 800 beds unoccupied. The attorneys also reject the notion that children's right to release encourages migration to the U.S."The Settlement has been in effect since 1997, yet Defendants offer no evidence establishing that its enforcement now encourages others to enter the United States without authorization. In any event, deterring others is simply not a lawful basis to refuse anyone release, much less vulnerable children," the lawyers wrote.One lawyer close to the case said Friday night that immigrant parents could waive their rights under Flores in order to keep their children with them, but could not be compelled to waive their right to have their child placed in a licensed center. Such a stance could flummox Trump's new family detention policy by giving authorities two stark choices the administration has said it wants to avoid: release the adult or break up the family. An attorney who argued for the injunction in the San Diego case, which is known as Ms. L., said that order does not require Trump to put families in extended detention. “The government's suggestion that the Flores settlement and the Ms. L case are in conflict is false,” said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union. “Neither the Ms. L case nor the Flores settlement remotely requires long term family detention, because the government can and constitutionally must release parents who do not pose a flight risk or danger. Moreover, as the government recognizes, notwithstanding the Ms. L case, parents can always choose to release their children if they do not want them to remain in a family detention center. Ultimately the Ms. L case leaves it up to parents to decide what is in the best interests of the child. Additionally, it would be flatly unconstitutional if the government's purpose in detaining families is punitive or is intended to serves as a deterrent.”Missing out on the latest scoops?

Reports typically include findings, conclusions, and recommendations based on information gathered by the committee and the committee’s deliberations. Each report has been subjected to a rigorous and independent peer-review process and it represents the position of the National Academies on the statement of task.The United States prides itself on being a nation of immigrants, and the country has a long history of successfully absorbing people from across the globe. The integration of immigrants and their children contributes to our economic vitality and our vibrant and ever changing culture. We have offered opportunities to immigrants and their children to better themselves and to be fully incorporated into our society and in exchange immigrants have become Americans - embracing an American identity and citizenship, protecting our country through service in our military, fostering technological innovation, harvesting its crops, and enriching everything from the nation's cuisine to its universities, music, and art.Today, the 41 million immigrants in the United States represent 13.1 percent of the U.S. population. The U.S.-born children of immigrants, the second generation, represent another 37.1 million people, or 12 percent of the population. Thus, together the first and second generations account for one out of four members of the U.S. population. Whether they are successfully integrating is therefore a pressing and important question. Are new immigrants and their children being well integrated into American society, within and across generations? Do current policies and practices facilitate their integration? How is American society being transformed by the millions of immigrants who have arrived in recent decades?To answer these questions, this new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine summarizes what we know about how immigrants and their descendants are integrating into American society in a range of areas such as education, occupations, health, and language.Mary C. Waters, chair of the Panel on the Integration of Immigrants into American Society, discusses the findings of the report.The National Academies Press and the Transportation Research Board have partnered with Copyright Clearance Center to offer a variety of options for reusing our content.

In addition, widespread reports of apparently imminent changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program — which has been in place since 2012 and has provided relief from deportation to more than 580,000 young unauthorized immigrants — could expand the immediately eligible DACA population by 290,000, bringing it to close to 1.5 million.In total, MPI estimates the anticipated new deferred action program and expanded DACA initiative could benefit as many as 5.2 million people — nearly half of the 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants living in the United States (see table below for national and top state breakdowns).“The president’s anticipated actions could have a significant effect on the lives of millions of unauthorized immigrants, improving job and educational prospects, the ability to apply for driver’s licenses and expanding engagement in their communities,” said MPI President Michael Fix.Under the anticipated announcement, 3.7 million parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents (aka green card holders) could apply for a grant of relief from deportation and work authorization under a new deferred action program, provided they have lived in the United States for five years or more. The potential DACA changes would reportedly eliminate the age cutoff (currently applicants must be under age 31) and move forward DACA’s U.S. residency requirement from 2007 to 2010.MPI has produced the following estimates of those potentially eligible for the new and expanded deferred action programs under the anticipated actions, using an innovative methodology to estimate the size and characteristics of the unauthorized immigrant population based on analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2008 Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP).Notes: Because a certain number of individuals could appear in more than one category, these estimates model these overlaps.  The estimates for the new deferred action program for parents exclude individuals eligible for DACA.Sources: For DACA estimates: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) by James Bachmeier of Temple University and Jennifer Van Hook of The Pennsylvania State University, Population Research Institute. For estimates of the new deferred action program for parents, sources are MPI analysis of 2008-2012 ACS data, pooled, and 2008 SIPP data by Bachmeier and Van Hook. For more detail on the methodology, see DACA at the Two-Year Mark: A National and State Profile of Youth Eligible and Applying for Deferred Action (Washington, DC: MPI, 2014).MPI has also developed estimates of the populations potentially eligible for the anticipated deferred action program for key states. The top 20 states are presented here; for data on the 41 states that MPI was able to estimate, see: www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/datahub/US-State-Estimates-u...​Sources: For DACA estimates: MPI analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 ACS and the 2008 SIPP by Bachmeier and Van Hook. For estimates of the new deferred action program for parents: MPI analysis of 2008-2012 ACS data, pooled, and 2008 SIPP data by Bachmeier and Van Hook.The DACA experience makes clear that not all potentially eligible applicants will apply. MPI has estimated that as of July 2014, 55 percent of those who met the DACA criteria had applied for relief. Application costs, fear of self-identifying as unauthorized or potentially exposing other unauthorized relatives to government scrutiny and lack of information about the program and its temporary nature were among the barriers.For more on unauthorized immigrant populations nationally and by state, including size of the overall population, countries of origin, top languages and more, check out a unique new MPI data tool with detailed profiles for the U.S., 41 states and the District of Columbia: http://migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program-data-hub/unauthorized-immigrant-population-profiles.#  #  #The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit think tank in Washington, DC dedicated to analysis of the movement of people worldwide.

            The effects of immigration on the total output and income of the U.S. economy can be studied by comparing output per worker and employment in states that have had large immigrant inflows with data from states that have few new foreign-born workers. Statistical analysis of state-level data shows that immigrants expand the economy’s productive capacity by stimulating investment and promoting specialization. This produces efficiency gains and boosts income per worker. At the same time, evidence is scant that immigrants diminish the employment opportunities of U.S.-born workers.Immigration in recent decades has significantly increased the presence of foreign-born workers in the United States. The impact of these immigrants on the U.S. economy is hotly debated. Some stories in the popular press suggest that immigrants diminish the job opportunities of workers born in the United States. Others portray immigrants as filling essential jobs that are shunned by other workers. Economists who have analyzed local labor markets have mostly failed to find large effects of immigrants on employment and wages of U.S.-born workers (see Borjas 2006; Card 2001, 2007, 2009; and Card and Lewis 2007).
This Economic Letter summarizes recent research by Peri (2009) and Peri and Sparber (2009) examining the impact of immigrants on the broader U.S. economy. These studies systematically analyze how immigrants affect total output, income per worker, and employment in the short and long run. Consistent with previous research, the analysis finds no significant effect of immigration on net job growth for U.S.-born workers in these time horizons. This suggests that the economy absorbs immigrants by expanding job opportunities rather than by displacing workers born in the United States. Second, at the state level, the presence of immigrants is associated with increased output per worker. This effect emerges in the medium to long run as businesses adjust their physical capital, that is, equipment and structures, to take advantage of the labor supplied by new immigrants. However, in the short run, when businesses have not fully adjusted their productive capacity, immigrants reduce the capital intensity of the economy. Finally, immigration is associated with an increase in average hours per worker and a reduction in skills per worker as measured by the share of college-educated workers in a state. These two effects have opposite and roughly equal effect on labor productivity.
The method
A major challenge to immigration research is the difficulty of identifying the effects of immigration on economic variables when we do not observe what would have happened if immigration levels had been different, all else being equal. To get around this problem, we take advantage of the fact that the increase in immigrants has been very uneven across states. For example, in California, one worker in three was foreign born in 2008, while in West Virginia the comparable proportion was only one in 100. By exploiting variations in the inflows of immigrants across states at 10-year intervals from 1960 to 2000, and annually from 1994 to 2008, we are able to estimate the short-run (one to two years), medium-run (four years), and long-run (seven to ten years) impact of immigrants on output, income, and employment.
To ensure that we are isolating the effects of immigrants rather than effects of other factors, we control for a range of variables that might contribute to differences in economic outcomes. These include sector specialization, research spending, openness to trade, technology adoption, and others. We then compare economic outcomes in states that experienced increases in immigrant inflows with states that did not experience significant increases.
As a further control for isolating the specific effects of immigration, we focus on variations in the flow of immigrants that are caused by geographical and historical factors and are not the result of state-specific economic conditions. For example, a state may experience rapid growth, which attracts a lot of immigrants and also affects output, income, and employment. In terms of geography, proximity to the Mexican border is associated with high net immigration because border states tend to get more immigrants. Historical migration patterns also are a factor because immigrants are drawn to areas with established immigrant communities. These geography and history-driven flows increase the presence of immigrants, but do not reflect state-specific economic conditions. Hence, economic outcomes associated with these flows are purer measures of the impact of immigrants on economic variables.
The short- and the long-run effects of immigrants

Figure 1 Employment and income

 

Immigration effects on employment, income, and productivity vary by occupation, job, and industry. Nonetheless, it is possible to total these effects to get an aggregate economic impact. Here we attempt to quantify the aggregate gains and losses for the U.S. economy from immigration. If the average impact on employment and income per worker is positive, this implies an aggregate “surplus” from immigration. In other words, the total gains accruing to some U.S.-born workers are larger than the total losses suffered by others.
Figures 1 and 2 show the response of key economic variables to an inflow of immigrants equal to 1% of employment. Figure 1 shows the impact on employment of U.S.-born workers and on average income per worker after one, two, four, seven, and ten years. Figure 2 shows the impact on the components of income per worker: physical capital intensity, as measured by capital per unit of output; skill intensity, as measured by human capital per worker; average hours worked; and total factor productivity, measuring productive efficiency and technological level. Some interesting patterns emerge.

Figure 2 Capital intensity, hours per worker, and total factor productivity

 

First, there is no evidence that immigrants crowd out U.S.-born workers in either the short or long run. Data on U.S.-born worker employment imply small effects, with estimates never statistically different from zero. The impact on hours per worker is similar. We observe insignificant effects in the short run and a small but significant positive effect in the long run. At the same time, immigration reduces somewhat the skill intensity of workers in the short and long run because immigrants have a slightly lower average education level than U.S.-born workers.
Second, the positive long-run effect on income per U.S.-born worker accrues over some time. In the short run, small insignificant effects are observed. Over the long run, however, a net inflow of immigrants equal to 1% of employment increases income per worker by 0.6% to 0.9%. This implies that total immigration to the United States from 1990 to 2007 was associated with a 6.6% to 9.9% increase in real income per worker. That equals an increase of about $5,100 in the yearly income of the average U.S. worker in constant 2005 dollars. Such a gain equals 20% to 25% of the total real increase in average yearly income per worker registered in the United States between 1990 and 2007.
The third result is that the long-run increase in income per worker associated with immigrants is mainly due to increases in the efficiency and productivity of state economies. This effect becomes apparent in the medium to long run. Such a gradual response of productivity is accompanied by a gradual response of capital intensity. While in the short run, physical capital per unit of output is decreased by net immigration, in the medium to long run, businesses expand their equipment and physical plant proportionally to their increase in production.
How can these patterns be explained?
The effects identified above can be explained by adjustments businesses make over time that allow them to take full advantage of the new immigrant labor supply. These adjustments, including upgrading and expanding capital stock, provide businesses with opportunities to expand in response to hiring immigrants.
This process can be analyzed at the state level (see Peri and Sparber 2009). The analysis begins with the well-documented phenomenon that U.S.-born workers and immigrants tend to take different occupations. Among less-educated workers, those born in the United States tend to have jobs in manufacturing or mining, while immigrants tend to have jobs in personal services and agriculture. Among more-educated workers, those born in the United States tend to work as managers, teachers, and nurses, while immigrants tend to work as engineers, scientists, and doctors. Second, within industries and specific businesses, immigrants and U.S.-born workers tend to specialize in different job tasks. Because those born in the United States have relatively better English language skills, they tend to specialize in communication tasks. Immigrants tend to specialize in other tasks, such as manual labor. Just as in the standard concept of comparative advantage, this results in specialization and improved production efficiency.

Figure 3 Communication/manual skills among less-educated U.S.-born workers

Note: The data on average communication/manual skills by state are from Peri and Sparber (2009), obtained from the manual and communication intensity of occupations, weighted according to the distributional occupation of U.S.-born workers.

If these patterns are driving the differences across states, then in states where immigration has been heavy, U.S.-born workers with less education should have shifted toward more communication-intensive jobs. Figure 3 shows exactly this. The share of immigrants among the less educated is strongly correlated with the extent of U.S.-born worker specialization in communication tasks. Each point in the graph represents a U.S. state in 2005. In states with a heavy concentration of less-educated immigrants, U.S.-born workers have migrated toward more communication-intensive occupations. Those jobs pay higher wages than manual jobs, so such a mechanism has stimulated the productivity of workers born in the United States and generated new employment opportunities.
To better understand this mechanism, it is useful to consider the following hypothetical illustration. As young immigrants with low schooling levels take manually intensive construction jobs, the construction companies that employ them have opportunities to expand. This increases the demand for construction supervisors, coordinators, designers, and so on. Those are occupations with greater communication intensity and are typically staffed by U.S.-born workers who have moved away from manual construction jobs. This complementary task specialization typically pushes U.S.-born workers toward better-paying jobs, enhances the efficiency of production, and creates jobs. This task specialization, however, may involve adoption of different techniques or managerial procedures and the renovation or replacement of capital equipment. Hence, it takes some years to be fully realized.
Conclusions
The U.S. economy is dynamic, shedding and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs every month. Businesses are in a continuous state of flux. The most accurate way to gauge the net impact of immigration on such an economy is to analyze the effects dynamically over time. Data show that, on net, immigrants expand the U.S. economy’s productive capacity, stimulate investment, and promote specialization that in the long run boosts productivity. Consistent with previous research, there is no evidence that these effects take place at the expense of jobs for workers born in the United States.

Immigration in recent decades has significantly increased the presence of foreign-born workers in the United States. The impact of these immigrants on the U.S. economy is hotly debated. Some stories in the popular press suggest that immigrants diminish the job opportunities of workers born in the United States. Others portray immigrants as filling essential jobs that are shunned by other workers. Economists who have analyzed local labor markets have mostly failed to find large effects of immigrants on employment and wages of U.S.-born workers (see Borjas 2006; Card 2001, 2007, 2009; and Card and Lewis 2007).This Economic Letter summarizes recent research by Peri (2009) and Peri and Sparber (2009) examining the impact of immigrants on the broader U.S. economy. These studies systematically analyze how immigrants affect total output, income per worker, and employment in the short and long run. Consistent with previous research, the analysis finds no significant effect of immigration on net job growth for U.S.-born workers in these time horizons. This suggests that the economy absorbs immigrants by expanding job opportunities rather than by displacing workers born in the United States. Second, at the state level, the presence of immigrants is associated with increased output per worker. This effect emerges in the medium to long run as businesses adjust their physical capital, that is, equipment and structures, to take advantage of the labor supplied by new immigrants. However, in the short run, when businesses have not fully adjusted their productive capacity, immigrants reduce the capital intensity of the economy.

The so-called problem of immigrants on the dole was nonetheless a major concern of the 1996 welfare reform law, the impact of which is still playing out today. While legal immigrants continue to pay taxes and are eligible for the draft, welfare reform has severely limited their access to government supports in times of crisis. Immigrants and Welfare The Impact of Welfare Reform on America's Newcomers rigorously assesses the welfare reform law, questions whether its immigrant provisions were ever really necessary, and examines its impact on legal immigrants’ ability to integrate into American society.Immigrants and Welfare draws on fields from demography and law to developmental psychology. The first part of the volume probes the politics behind the welfare reform law, its legal underpinnings, and what it may mean for integration policy. The second part of the book focuses on empirical research regarding immigrants’ propensity to use benefits before the law passed, and immigrants’ use and hardship levels afterwards.Even though few states took the federal government’s invitation with the 1996 welfare reform law to completely freeze legal immigrants out of the social safety net, many of the law’s most far-reaching provisions remain in place and have significant implications for immigrants. Immigrants and Welfare takes a balanced look at the politics and history of immigrant access to safety-net supports and the ongoing impacts of welfare.Immigrants and Welfare: OverviewMichael E.

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia offer in-state tuition to unauthorized immigrant students by state legislative action and five states by state university systems. Sixteen state legislatures—California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Washington—and the District of Columbia—enacted laws to allow in-state tuition benefits for certain unauthorized immigrant students.These laws typically require attendance and graduation at state high schools, acceptance at a state college or university, and promising to apply for legal status as soon as eligible. At least five state university systems—the University of Hawaii Board of Regents, University of Maine Board of Trustees, University of Michigan Board of Regents, Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and Rhode Island’s Board of Governors for Higher Education—established policies to offer in-state tuition rates to unauthorized immigrant students.Delaware has considered but not enacted legislation, but two universities in that state—Delaware Technical Community College and the University of Delaware—allow undocumented students to be eligible for in-state tuition and financial aid.In 2018, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington enacted laws allowing certain immigrant students, such as students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), to be eligible for financial aid.At least nine states—California, Connecticut, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas and Washington—offer state financial assistance to certain undocumented immigrant students including DACA students. Several states, including Utah, allow public universities to use private sources of funding to support financial aid to unauthorized immigrant students.Six states—Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri and South Carolina—bar unauthorized immigrant students from in-state tuition benefits. StateBillYearSummaryStates offering in-state tuition through state legislationCaliforniaA 540       S 68    A 343  2001       2017    2017This law requires that an unlawful immigrant, other than a nonimmigrant alien, be exempted from paying nonresident tuition at state community colleges and the state university if these conditions are met:  attendance at a state high school for three or more years, graduation from a California high school or the equivalent, registration at or attendance at an accredited higher education institution in the state, and has filed an affidavit stating that the student has applied to legalize his or her immigration status, or will file an application as soon as he or she is eligible. This law expands eligibility created in AB 540 (2001) for in-state tuition for students at California's public postsecondary institutions, other than nonimmigrant aliens, to students who have completed three or more years of attendance at an elementary school, secondary school, adult school and/or California Community College. This law exempts students who have been granted special immigrant visas or are refugees from paying nonresident tuition at the California State University and the California Community Colleges.ColoradoS 332013This law allows students without lawful immigration status to be considered in-state residents and exempts people receiving higher education benefits from having to provide documentation of lawful presence in the United States.ConnecticutH 6390    H 6844    S 42011    2015    2018 This law extends in-state tuition benefits to postsecondary students without legal immigration status who reside in Connecticut and meet certain criteria. It requires them to file an affidavit with a college stating that they have applied to legalize their immigration status or will do so as soon as they are eligible to apply. Amends existing law related to requirements for residents, other than certain nonimmigrant aliens, to be classified as an in-state for tuition purposes. Students must have completed at least two years of high school in the state, rather than the previous four-year requirement. This law allows any person who was 30 years old or younger on June 15, 2012, or was 16 years old or younger when he or she arrived in the United States and has continuously resided in the United States since such arrival, and has not been convicted of a felony in this state or in another state, to be eligible to receive in-state tuition.FloridaH 8512014This postsecondary education law includes amendments relating to qualifications for resident (in-state) tuition. Out-of-state fees are waived for students, including but not limited to those undocumented for federal immigration purposes who have attended a secondary school for three years before graduating from a Florida high school, applied for higher education enrollment within two years of graduation, and submitted an official Florida high school transcript as evidence of attendance and graduation. A dependent child who is a United States citizen may not be denied classification as a resident for tuition purposes based solely upon the immigration status of his or her parent. The law prohibits denial of classification as a resident for tuition purposes based on immigration status and allows certain people to be classified as state residents based on marriage or military service.IllinoisH 602003This law allows in-state tuition for a person who is not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States who files an affidavit stating intent to apply for citizenship as soon as is possible.KansasH 21452004This law allows certain nonresidents to be deemed to be residents for purposes of tuition and other fees at postsecondary educational institutions and makes provisions for people without lawful immigration status under certain circumstances.MarylandS 1672011This law authorizes in-state tuition benefits at a local community college to unauthorized students who have graduated from public high schools. Parents must be able to prove they pay Maryland taxes to receive in-state tuition. After two years, students have the option of transferring to a state university at in-state tuition rates. Students who are not permanent residents must provide to the public college an affidavit stating that they will file an application to become a permanent resident within 30 days after becoming eligible to do so.MinnesotaS 12362013This law establishes criteria by which students without lawful immigration status may qualify for the resident tuition rate in state universities and colleges. It also provides for the treatment of undocumented immigrants with respect to financial aid and tuition and public institutions may also use private sources of funding to provide aid to a student eligible for resident tuition.NebraskaL 2392006This law redefines “residency” and “lawful status” for the sake of in-state tuition eligibility and allows those residing in the state for three years or more, and who meet other criteria, to become eligible for in-state tuition.New JerseyS 24792013This law provides in-state tuition and state financial aid if the individual attended high school for three years, graduated or received the equivalent of a high school diploma and enrolls in a public institution of higher education in 2014. If the person does not have lawful status, he or she must file an affidavit to legalize when eligible to do so.New MexicoS 5822005This law prohibits denial of college benefits based on a student’s immigration status. It provides for in-state tuition and state-funded financial aid to be granted on the same terms to all people, regardless of immigration status.New YorkS 77842001This law provides that payment of State University of New York or City University of New York tuition by certain non-resident students shall be paid at a rate no greater than that imposed on resident students.OregonH 27872013This law exempts students who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from nonresident tuition and fees if the following conditions are met: three years of attendance at an Oregon school; five years attendance in any U.S., D.C. or Puerto Rico elementary or secondary school; receipt of a high school diploma or equivalent in Oregon within three years of enrolling in a public university in Oregon.

Given this make-up, large swaths of people will suffer from any actions that target unauthorized immigrants.Nationally, more than 16.7 million people have at least one unauthorized family member living with them, among whom nearly 50 percent, or 8.2 million, are U.S.-born or naturalized citizens. In fact, there are 5.9 million citizen children who will potentially be at risk if their unauthorized family members are targeted.Below is an interactive map that illustrates the state-by-state distribution of family members and children among them—broken down by total population, U.S.-born, and naturalized citizen family members—of unauthorized immigrants who will be harmed by anti-immigrant actions. Each state’s population will suffer: For example, in Texas, there are nearly 2.7 million people who have at least one unauthorized family member living with them. Among them, approximately 1.4 million are U.S.-born or naturalized, more than 1 million of whom are children. These estimates are conservative since they do not include family members who do not live in the same household.Download the complete Excel worksheet to see data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.For a full-size version of the interactive, click here.Note: “Children” refers to people under 18 years of age.Sources: Author’s analysis of estimates by the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration using Steven Ruggles and others, “Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, Version 6.0: American Community Survey, 2010–2014,” available at https://usa.ipums.org/usa/ (last accessed March 2016); based on methodology from Manuel Pastor, Tom Jawetz, and Lizet Ocampo, “DAPA Matters: The Growing Electorate Directly Affected by Executive Action on Immigration” (Washington: Center for American Progress, 2015), available at https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/report/2015/11/19/125787/dapa-matters/.ITEP's Email Digest

Read as PDF (Includes Full Appendix of State-by-State data)Leer en EspañolReport Landing PagePublic debates over federal immigration reform, specifically around undocumented immigrants, often suffer from insufficient and inaccurate information about the tax contributions of undocumented immigrants, particularly at the state level. The truth is that undocumented immigrants living in the United States pay billions of dollars each year in state and local taxes. Further, these tax contributions would increase significantly if all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States were granted a pathway to citizenship as part of a comprehensive immigration reform.  Or put in the reverse, if undocumented immigrants are deported in high numbers, state and local revenues could take a substantial hit.Accurate information about the tax contributions of undocumented immigrants is needed now more than ever. Divisive and objectionable rhetoric has not tempered in the early months of the Trump administration. Policies adopted and supported by the new administration are haphazard in design and impact; they characterize undocumented families as criminals and encourage indiscriminate deportations. Good policy is informed policy. Just like the horrendous impact of breaking up families should not be ignored, neither should the lost tax contributions from isolating or deporting undocumented immigrants.To better inform the ongoing debates on immigration policy reform, this report provides state-by-state and national estimates on the current state and local tax contributions of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States as of 2014, and the increase in contributions if all these taxpayers were granted legal status as part of comprehensive reform. [1]Key Findings:Undocumented Immigrants Pay State and Local Taxes: Current ContributionsLike other people living and working in the United States, undocumented immigrants pay state and local taxes. They pay sales and excise taxes when they purchase goods and services (for example, on utilities, clothing and gasoline). They pay property taxes directly on their homes or indirectly as renters. Many undocumented immigrants also pay state income taxes. The best evidence suggests that at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households currently file income tax returns using Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs), and many who do not file income tax returns still have taxes deducted from their paychecks.[4]Collectively, undocumented immigrants in the United States pay an estimated total of $11.74 billion in state and local taxes a year (see Table 1 for state-by-state estimates). This includes more than $7 billion in sales and excise taxes, $3.6 billion in property taxes, and $1.1 billion in personal income taxes.Another way to measure the state and local taxes that undocumented immigrants pay is through their effective tax rate, which is the share of total income paid in taxes. The effective tax rate is useful for more accurate state-to-state comparisons because it accounts for differences between states’ tax structures and population size. Undocumented immigrants’ nationwide average effective tax rate is an estimated 8 percent. To put this in perspective, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay an average nationwide effective tax rate of just 5.4 percent.[5]Table 1: Undocumented Immigrants’ State and Local Tax Contributions
Current vs. Full Legal Status for All Undocumented Immigrants
Granting Legal Status to All Undocumented Immigrants Would Boost Their State and Local Tax ContributionsCreating a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States and allowing them to work here legally would boost their current state and local tax contributions by more than $2.18 billion a year (see Table 1). Personal income tax collections would increase by $1.1 billion a year. Sales and excise taxes would increase by $702 million, and property taxes would grow by $362 million. As a result, the overall state and local taxes paid by undocumented immigrants as a share of their income would increase from 8 percent to 8.6 percent.The most significant revenue gain would come from the personal income tax, due to both increased earnings and full compliance with the tax code.[6] Multiple studies have shown that legal immigrants have higher wages than undocumented immigrants, thus gaining legal status could lead to a boost in wages. The wage boost is in part due to better job opportunities that would be made available to workers with legal status and also in part to an increased access to higher-level skills and better training. Most comprehensive reform measures to date have included strong incentives or requirements for undocumented immigrants granted legal status to fully comply with tax law.ConclusionUndocumented immigrants make considerable tax contributions. Like other immigrants and U.S. citizens they purchase goods and services, work, and live across the country. Proposals to remove immigrants ignore their many contributions. In a time when most states are facing revenue shortages, the potential budgetary impacts of mass deportation merits careful consideration. States could lose an estimated $11.74 billion in revenue if all undocumented immigrants were removed. In addition to the many humanitarian, public health, and moral arguments for a pathway to legal citizenship and against mass deportations, there is also a state fiscal component that should not be ignored.See Appendix 1 for state-by-state estimates of the current and post-reform state and local tax contributions of the total undocumented immigrant population. The appendix includes effective tax rates and totals for sales and excise, personal income, and property taxes.MethodologyWhile the spending and income behavior of undocumented immigrant families is not as well documented as that of US citizens, the estimates in this report represent a best approximation of the taxes families headed by undocumented immigrants likely pay.The ITEP methodology used to calculate the current and potential tax contribution of undocumented immigrants uses five main data points:1. Estimated undocumented immigrant population in each state
2. Average size of undocumented immigrant families/taxpaying units
3. Range of annual undocumented immigrant family/taxpayer income in each state
4. Estimated number of undocumented immigrants who are homeowners
5. Estimated effective tax rates (taxes as share of income) for sales, income, and property taxes paid by low- and moderate-income families in each stateAdditional assumptions are made (and described below) about the change in tax contributions that would occur if all 11 million undocumented immigrants were granted legal status under comprehensive immigration reform.See Appendix 2 for state-by-state details on data used to assist in calculating the state and local tax contributions.1. Estimated undocumented immigrant population in each stateEstimates of each state’s undocumented immigrant population are from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI).[7] According to MPI, an estimated 11,090,000 undocumented immigrants resided in the U.S. as of 2014 (an estimate that is only 13,000 lower than MPI’s estimate from 2013 data).2.  Average size of undocumented immigrant families/taxpaying unitsThe Pew Research Center calculated a nationwide estimate of the number of people per undocumented immigrant family. The most recent estimate, 2.29, is used to find an estimated number of undocumented families (or taxpaying units) by state.[8] ITEP divided population estimates for each state by the average family size to find an estimated number of undocumented families/taxpaying units living in each state.3. Range of annual undocumented immigrant family/taxpayer income in each stateEstimates of the income distribution of undocumented families are from MPI data on the number of undocumented immigrants in five discrete income groups based on the 2014 federal poverty level.[9] ITEP used the midpoint of the income ranges in each group as an estimate of average income within each group and multiplied by the number of families/taxpaying units in each group to calculate aggregate income in these groups.4. Estimated number of undocumented immigrants who are homeowners ITEP used MPI data on undocumented families’ homeownership rates for each state. We then calculated separate property tax incidence analyses for homeowners and renters in each state. Applying the homeowner effective tax rates to the homeowner population and the renter tax rates to the renter population yielded a combined property tax estimate for all undocumented families in each state.[10]5. Estimated effective tax rates (taxes as share of income) for sales, income, and property taxes paid by low- and moderate-income families in each state[11]ITEP’s microsimulation computer model is a sophisticated program that applies the state and local tax laws in each state (including sales, excise, income, and property tax laws) to a statistically valid database of tax returns to generate estimates of the effective tax rates paid by taxpayers at various income levels under state and local tax law in place as of December 31, 2014. In January of 2015, ITEP released the 5th edition of Who Pays? which estimates the effect of the state and local tax laws as of January 2015 on taxpayers at 2012 income levels. This report applies effective tax rates calculated in the 2015 Who Pays? report to the undocumented population with one exception. The effective tax rates in seven states: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island were slightly modified for the analysis to include the enactment, enhancement, or reduction of state EITCs in 2015 and 2016 (this change applies only to the analysis granting legal status and does not impact the current tax contributions).The following assumptions were made to calculate the sales, income, and property taxes of the undocumented immigration population:Additional indicators used to make calculations for anticipated state and local tax changes if legal status is granted as part of comprehensive immigration reform:Changes from ITEP’s February 2016 Undocumented Immigrants’ State & Local Tax Contributions ReportThe analysis presented in this report is an update to an ITEP report published in 2016. The 2017 report uses 2014 estimates on the undocumented immigrant population (size, income, homeownership, and population impacted by the executive actions) whereas the 2016 report used 2013 data. Most notably, the number of undocumented immigrants remained relatively flat. It declined by only about 13,000 between 2013 and 2014, however the amount of estimated income rose slightly. The steady population and slight changes in income led to a small increase in the total amount of state and local taxes undocumented immigrants pay in the 2017study compared to the 2016 study. [1] Migration Policy Institute (MPI) analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2010-2014 ACS pooled, and the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) by Colin Hammar and James Bachmeier of Temple University and Jennifer Van Hook of Pennsylvania State University, Population Research Institute.[2] See the methodology section for more information on the calculation of estimated undocumented immigrant state and local tax payments.[3] Davis, Carl, et al. “Who Pays?

Meg WieheMisha HillRead as PDF (Includes Appendices of State-by-State Data)IntroductionThe Trump administration’s immigration policies have broken apart families and removed established members of communities. The administration’s disregard for the contributions of immigrants, regardless of their legal status, is of real concern for young immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States as children. Many of those young immigrants qualify for deferred deportation action and legal work authorization under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a 2012 executive order under President Barack Obama.In September 2017, President Trump used his executive powers to order the rescission of DACA on March 5, 2018 unless Congress enacted permanent protections. Trump’s executive action was met by multiple lawsuits from state attorneys general and other parties that would be economically injured if DACA recipients lost their protections or were deported. Before the March 5 deadline, two federal rulings prevented the termination of the program but the administration did not have to accept new applications or renewals.On April 24, 2018, a federal judge ordered that the administration must reinstate the program and begin accepting new applications and renewals—the administration has 90 days to respond. The legal status of the young people eligible for and currently enrolled in DACA is very much in flux.More than 1.3 million out of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States are eligible for DACA. As of January 2018, more than 682,000 individuals were enrolled in the program.[i] DACA offers eligible teenagers and young adults who were brought to the United States as children outside of their control temporary deferral from deportation and legal work authorization.[ii]  US Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) releases quarterly updates of DACA population estimates. These most recently available figures are smaller than previous estimates because they exclude former DACA enrollees who are now legal permanent residents, those who did not reapply, and those whose reapplication was denied. Additionally, the Trump administrations’ rescission of DACA and the ongoing court cases have prevented and discouraged eligible DACA recipients from applying or reapplying. At this time, the most important population to consider is the total eligible population of 1.3 million Dreamers as this group will be most impacted by future decisions relating to DACA. This report will use the term Dreamers to refer to the combined population of young immigrants who are enrolled in DACA and those who are eligible for DACA but not enrolled.DACA enrollment has helped young immigrants become more engaged in their communities. A national survey of DACA enrollees in 2017 found that more than 50 percent of respondents secured their first job after enrollment in DACA, and nearly 70 percent landed a job with better pay. DACA enrollment also allowed 65 percent of respondents to pursue educational opportunities that were previously unavailable to them, and more than 70 percent of respondents hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.[iii]The 1.3 million Dreamers eligible for deferred action contribute tax dollars to communities that help pay for schools, public infrastructure, and other services. Their contributions could be increased by taking steps to ensure that all individuals eligible for deferred action are enrolled, or even by offering a path to citizenship. Conversely, stripping their temporary lawful status or deporting them would decrease their tax contributions and deprive our country of a dedicated and diverse generation.An ITEP report from March 2017 found the 11 million undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States contribute more than $11.74 billion in state and local taxes.[iv] This report specifically examines the state and local tax contributions of undocumented immigrants who are currently enrolled or immediately eligible for DACA and the fiscal implications of various policy changes. The report includes information on the national impact (Chart 1) and provides a state-by-state breakdown (Appendices 1 and 2).Key Findings How Dreamers Contribute to State and Local Revenue
Questions have frequently been raised about the taxes paid by undocumented immigrants. Everyone living and working in the U.S. contributes to state and local taxes, regardless of their immigration status. We all pay sales and excise taxes when we purchase goods and services, such as clothing or gasoline. We all pay property taxes either directly for our homes or indirectly as renters.DACA provides young immigrants with work authorization and recipients are subject to the same state and local personal income tax laws as all lawfully present workers. Additionally, DACA recipients have (temporary) Social Security numbers. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that working DACA recipients file and pay state and local income taxes just like any other working American. As ITEP’s 2017 report demonstrated, about half of undocumented immigrants of all ages file income tax returns. They do this using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) in the absence of having valid Social Security numbers. Therefore we assume that young immigrants who are eligible for but not enrolled in DACA comply with income tax law at a similar rate.The tax revenues generated by DACA recipients are further boosted by the fact that DACA status boosts employment rates and wages. A national survey of DACA recipients found that employment rates increased by 127 percent after enrollment, from 44 percent of respondents employed to 91 percent.[vii]  Evidence also shows that relief from deportation and temporary work permits through programs like DACA also boosts undocumented immigrants’ wages by at least 8.5 percent. When given the opportunity to work legally and a reprieve from deportation DACA recipients are able to work more, earn more wages, and are less likely to be victims of wage theft from unscrupulous employers.Based on this evidence, we assume that 91 percent of the 682,000 young immigrants currently enrolled in DACA are employed, and that they are earning, on average, 8.5 percent more than the estimated 643,000 young people eligible for but not receiving DACA. The higher earnings, higher employment rate, and higher tax compliance rate of individuals enrolled in DACA leads to their increased tax contributions and higher effective tax rate compared to those eligible for but not receiving DACA. The total contributions of all Dreamers who are currently receiving or eligible for DACA status is over $1.7 billion in state and local taxes annually. If all eligible individuals were enrolled in DACA, those state and local tax contributions would increase by more than $815 million due to higher earnings, higher employment rate, and 100 percent tax compliance for all DACA eligible immigrants (see Table 1).In contrast, failing to maintain work authorizations and deportation relief of DACA would hurt state and local coffers. If the 682,000 young immigrants currently enrolled lost the protections of DACA, it would reduce their state and local tax contributions by nearly $700 million (see Table 1).ConclusionEvery state benefits from the tax contributions of young undocumented immigrants, but every state has much more to lose if we remove the protections and work authorization granted to these young people. On average, DACA recipients were only 6 years old when they were brought to this country. DACA recipients are part of the American family and over 70 percent have a U.S. citizen spouse, child, or sibling.[viii] Dreamers are our neighbors, classmates, and co-workers, and they have called this country home for most of their lives.  In its attempt to rescind DACA and increased detention and deportation enforcement, the Trump administration has broken a promise America made with these young people. If the Trump administration continues on this path, the nation risks forcing Dreamers back into the shadows and losing the economic and societal contributions these engaged young people are making in our communities.MethodologyITEP estimates the state and local tax contributions of DACA-eligible immigrants under different policy options through the methodology detailed below.This is a very conservative estimate. A 2017 nationally representative survey found the average annual income of working DACA recipients to be $36,231 while their average annual income prior to enrollment was $20,068. This represents an 81% increase in wages.[xiii]ITEP’s microsimulation computer model is a sophisticated program that applies the state and local tax laws in each state (including sales, excise, income, and property tax laws) to a statistically valid database of tax returns to generate estimates of the effective tax rates paid by taxpayers at various income levels under state and local tax law in place as of December 31, 2014. In January of 2015, ITEP released the 5th edition of Who Pays? which estimates the effect of the state and local tax laws as of January 2015 on taxpayers at 2012 income levels.

Note: the previous version of this report cited the effective tax rates paid after subtracting the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or federal offset. After the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the federal offset is almost non-existent. Thus, the most appropriate effective tax rate to reference is without deducting the federal offset.

In addition, widespread reports of apparently imminent changes to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program — which has been in place since 2012 and has provided relief from deportation to more than 580,000 young unauthorized immigrants — could expand the immediately eligible DACA population by 290,000, bringing it to close to 1.5 million.In total, MPI estimates the anticipated new deferred action program and expanded DACA initiative could benefit as many as 5.2 million people — nearly half of the 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants living in the United States (see table below for national and top state breakdowns).“The president’s anticipated actions could have a significant effect on the lives of millions of unauthorized immigrants, improving job and educational prospects, the ability to apply for driver’s licenses and expanding engagement in their communities,” said MPI President Michael Fix.Under the anticipated announcement, 3.7 million parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents (aka green card holders) could apply for a grant of relief from deportation and work authorization under a new deferred action program, provided they have lived in the United States for five years or more. The potential DACA changes would reportedly eliminate the age cutoff (currently applicants must be under age 31) and move forward DACA’s U.S. residency requirement from 2007 to 2010.MPI has produced the following estimates of those potentially eligible for the new and expanded deferred action programs under the anticipated actions, using an innovative methodology to estimate the size and characteristics of the unauthorized immigrant population based on analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2008 Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP).Notes: Because a certain number of individuals could appear in more than one category, these estimates model these overlaps.  The estimates for the new deferred action program for parents exclude individuals eligible for DACA.Sources: For DACA estimates: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) by James Bachmeier of Temple University and Jennifer Van Hook of The Pennsylvania State University, Population Research Institute. For estimates of the new deferred action program for parents, sources are MPI analysis of 2008-2012 ACS data, pooled, and 2008 SIPP data by Bachmeier and Van Hook. For more detail on the methodology, see DACA at the Two-Year Mark: A National and State Profile of Youth Eligible and Applying for Deferred Action (Washington, DC: MPI, 2014).MPI has also developed estimates of the populations potentially eligible for the anticipated deferred action program for key states. The top 20 states are presented here; for data on the 41 states that MPI was able to estimate, see: www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/datahub/US-State-Estimates-u...​Sources: For DACA estimates: MPI analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 ACS and the 2008 SIPP by Bachmeier and Van Hook. For estimates of the new deferred action program for parents: MPI analysis of 2008-2012 ACS data, pooled, and 2008 SIPP data by Bachmeier and Van Hook.The DACA experience makes clear that not all potentially eligible applicants will apply. MPI has estimated that as of July 2014, 55 percent of those who met the DACA criteria had applied for relief. Application costs, fear of self-identifying as unauthorized or potentially exposing other unauthorized relatives to government scrutiny and lack of information about the program and its temporary nature were among the barriers.For more on unauthorized immigrant populations nationally and by state, including size of the overall population, countries of origin, top languages and more, check out a unique new MPI data tool with detailed profiles for the U.S., 41 states and the District of Columbia: http://migrationpolicy.org/programs/us-immigration-policy-program-data-hub/unauthorized-immigrant-population-profiles.#  #  #The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit think tank in Washington, DC dedicated to analysis of the movement of people worldwide.

Read as PDF (Includes Full Appendix of State-by-State data)Leer en EspañolReport Landing PagePublic debates over federal immigration reform, specifically around undocumented immigrants, often suffer from insufficient and inaccurate information about the tax contributions of undocumented immigrants, particularly at the state level. The truth is that undocumented immigrants living in the United States pay billions of dollars each year in state and local taxes. Further, these tax contributions would increase significantly if all undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States were granted a pathway to citizenship as part of a comprehensive immigration reform.  Or put in the reverse, if undocumented immigrants are deported in high numbers, state and local revenues could take a substantial hit.Accurate information about the tax contributions of undocumented immigrants is needed now more than ever. Divisive and objectionable rhetoric has not tempered in the early months of the Trump administration. Policies adopted and supported by the new administration are haphazard in design and impact; they characterize undocumented families as criminals and encourage indiscriminate deportations. Good policy is informed policy. Just like the horrendous impact of breaking up families should not be ignored, neither should the lost tax contributions from isolating or deporting undocumented immigrants.To better inform the ongoing debates on immigration policy reform, this report provides state-by-state and national estimates on the current state and local tax contributions of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States as of 2014, and the increase in contributions if all these taxpayers were granted legal status as part of comprehensive reform. [1]Key Findings:Undocumented Immigrants Pay State and Local Taxes: Current ContributionsLike other people living and working in the United States, undocumented immigrants pay state and local taxes. They pay sales and excise taxes when they purchase goods and services (for example, on utilities, clothing and gasoline). They pay property taxes directly on their homes or indirectly as renters. Many undocumented immigrants also pay state income taxes. The best evidence suggests that at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households currently file income tax returns using Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs), and many who do not file income tax returns still have taxes deducted from their paychecks.[4]Collectively, undocumented immigrants in the United States pay an estimated total of $11.74 billion in state and local taxes a year (see Table 1 for state-by-state estimates). This includes more than $7 billion in sales and excise taxes, $3.6 billion in property taxes, and $1.1 billion in personal income taxes.Another way to measure the state and local taxes that undocumented immigrants pay is through their effective tax rate, which is the share of total income paid in taxes. The effective tax rate is useful for more accurate state-to-state comparisons because it accounts for differences between states’ tax structures and population size. Undocumented immigrants’ nationwide average effective tax rate is an estimated 8 percent. To put this in perspective, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay an average nationwide effective tax rate of just 5.4 percent.[5]Table 1: Undocumented Immigrants’ State and Local Tax Contributions
Current vs. Full Legal Status for All Undocumented Immigrants
Granting Legal Status to All Undocumented Immigrants Would Boost Their State and Local Tax ContributionsCreating a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States and allowing them to work here legally would boost their current state and local tax contributions by more than $2.18 billion a year (see Table 1). Personal income tax collections would increase by $1.1 billion a year. Sales and excise taxes would increase by $702 million, and property taxes would grow by $362 million. As a result, the overall state and local taxes paid by undocumented immigrants as a share of their income would increase from 8 percent to 8.6 percent.The most significant revenue gain would come from the personal income tax, due to both increased earnings and full compliance with the tax code.[6] Multiple studies have shown that legal immigrants have higher wages than undocumented immigrants, thus gaining legal status could lead to a boost in wages. The wage boost is in part due to better job opportunities that would be made available to workers with legal status and also in part to an increased access to higher-level skills and better training. Most comprehensive reform measures to date have included strong incentives or requirements for undocumented immigrants granted legal status to fully comply with tax law.ConclusionUndocumented immigrants make considerable tax contributions. Like other immigrants and U.S. citizens they purchase goods and services, work, and live across the country. Proposals to remove immigrants ignore their many contributions. In a time when most states are facing revenue shortages, the potential budgetary impacts of mass deportation merits careful consideration. States could lose an estimated $11.74 billion in revenue if all undocumented immigrants were removed. In addition to the many humanitarian, public health, and moral arguments for a pathway to legal citizenship and against mass deportations, there is also a state fiscal component that should not be ignored.See Appendix 1 for state-by-state estimates of the current and post-reform state and local tax contributions of the total undocumented immigrant population. The appendix includes effective tax rates and totals for sales and excise, personal income, and property taxes.MethodologyWhile the spending and income behavior of undocumented immigrant families is not as well documented as that of US citizens, the estimates in this report represent a best approximation of the taxes families headed by undocumented immigrants likely pay.The ITEP methodology used to calculate the current and potential tax contribution of undocumented immigrants uses five main data points:1. Estimated undocumented immigrant population in each state
2. Average size of undocumented immigrant families/taxpaying units
3. Range of annual undocumented immigrant family/taxpayer income in each state
4. Estimated number of undocumented immigrants who are homeowners
5. Estimated effective tax rates (taxes as share of income) for sales, income, and property taxes paid by low- and moderate-income families in each stateAdditional assumptions are made (and described below) about the change in tax contributions that would occur if all 11 million undocumented immigrants were granted legal status under comprehensive immigration reform.See Appendix 2 for state-by-state details on data used to assist in calculating the state and local tax contributions.1. Estimated undocumented immigrant population in each stateEstimates of each state’s undocumented immigrant population are from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI).[7] According to MPI, an estimated 11,090,000 undocumented immigrants resided in the U.S. as of 2014 (an estimate that is only 13,000 lower than MPI’s estimate from 2013 data).2.  Average size of undocumented immigrant families/taxpaying unitsThe Pew Research Center calculated a nationwide estimate of the number of people per undocumented immigrant family. The most recent estimate, 2.29, is used to find an estimated number of undocumented families (or taxpaying units) by state.[8] ITEP divided population estimates for each state by the average family size to find an estimated number of undocumented families/taxpaying units living in each state.3. Range of annual undocumented immigrant family/taxpayer income in each stateEstimates of the income distribution of undocumented families are from MPI data on the number of undocumented immigrants in five discrete income groups based on the 2014 federal poverty level.[9] ITEP used the midpoint of the income ranges in each group as an estimate of average income within each group and multiplied by the number of families/taxpaying units in each group to calculate aggregate income in these groups.4. Estimated number of undocumented immigrants who are homeowners ITEP used MPI data on undocumented families’ homeownership rates for each state. We then calculated separate property tax incidence analyses for homeowners and renters in each state. Applying the homeowner effective tax rates to the homeowner population and the renter tax rates to the renter population yielded a combined property tax estimate for all undocumented families in each state.[10]5. Estimated effective tax rates (taxes as share of income) for sales, income, and property taxes paid by low- and moderate-income families in each state[11]ITEP’s microsimulation computer model is a sophisticated program that applies the state and local tax laws in each state (including sales, excise, income, and property tax laws) to a statistically valid database of tax returns to generate estimates of the effective tax rates paid by taxpayers at various income levels under state and local tax law in place as of December 31, 2014. In January of 2015, ITEP released the 5th edition of Who Pays? which estimates the effect of the state and local tax laws as of January 2015 on taxpayers at 2012 income levels. This report applies effective tax rates calculated in the 2015 Who Pays? report to the undocumented population with one exception. The effective tax rates in seven states: California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Rhode Island were slightly modified for the analysis to include the enactment, enhancement, or reduction of state EITCs in 2015 and 2016 (this change applies only to the analysis granting legal status and does not impact the current tax contributions).The following assumptions were made to calculate the sales, income, and property taxes of the undocumented immigration population:Additional indicators used to make calculations for anticipated state and local tax changes if legal status is granted as part of comprehensive immigration reform:Changes from ITEP’s February 2016 Undocumented Immigrants’ State & Local Tax Contributions ReportThe analysis presented in this report is an update to an ITEP report published in 2016. The 2017 report uses 2014 estimates on the undocumented immigrant population (size, income, homeownership, and population impacted by the executive actions) whereas the 2016 report used 2013 data. Most notably, the number of undocumented immigrants remained relatively flat. It declined by only about 13,000 between 2013 and 2014, however the amount of estimated income rose slightly. The steady population and slight changes in income led to a small increase in the total amount of state and local taxes undocumented immigrants pay in the 2017study compared to the 2016 study. [1] Migration Policy Institute (MPI) analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2010-2014 ACS pooled, and the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) by Colin Hammar and James Bachmeier of Temple University and Jennifer Van Hook of Pennsylvania State University, Population Research Institute.[2] See the methodology section for more information on the calculation of estimated undocumented immigrant state and local tax payments.[3] Davis, Carl, et al. “Who Pays?

Meg WieheMisha HillRead as PDF (Includes Appendices of State-by-State Data)IntroductionThe Trump administration’s immigration policies have broken apart families and removed established members of communities. The administration’s disregard for the contributions of immigrants, regardless of their legal status, is of real concern for young immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States as children. Many of those young immigrants qualify for deferred deportation action and legal work authorization under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a 2012 executive order under President Barack Obama.In September 2017, President Trump used his executive powers to order the rescission of DACA on March 5, 2018 unless Congress enacted permanent protections. Trump’s executive action was met by multiple lawsuits from state attorneys general and other parties that would be economically injured if DACA recipients lost their protections or were deported. Before the March 5 deadline, two federal rulings prevented the termination of the program but the administration did not have to accept new applications or renewals.On April 24, 2018, a federal judge ordered that the administration must reinstate the program and begin accepting new applications and renewals—the administration has 90 days to respond. The legal status of the young people eligible for and currently enrolled in DACA is very much in flux.More than 1.3 million out of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States are eligible for DACA. As of January 2018, more than 682,000 individuals were enrolled in the program.[i] DACA offers eligible teenagers and young adults who were brought to the United States as children outside of their control temporary deferral from deportation and legal work authorization.[ii]  US Customs and Immigration Services (USCIS) releases quarterly updates of DACA population estimates. These most recently available figures are smaller than previous estimates because they exclude former DACA enrollees who are now legal permanent residents, those who did not reapply, and those whose reapplication was denied. Additionally, the Trump administrations’ rescission of DACA and the ongoing court cases have prevented and discouraged eligible DACA recipients from applying or reapplying. At this time, the most important population to consider is the total eligible population of 1.3 million Dreamers as this group will be most impacted by future decisions relating to DACA. This report will use the term Dreamers to refer to the combined population of young immigrants who are enrolled in DACA and those who are eligible for DACA but not enrolled.DACA enrollment has helped young immigrants become more engaged in their communities. A national survey of DACA enrollees in 2017 found that more than 50 percent of respondents secured their first job after enrollment in DACA, and nearly 70 percent landed a job with better pay. DACA enrollment also allowed 65 percent of respondents to pursue educational opportunities that were previously unavailable to them, and more than 70 percent of respondents hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.[iii]The 1.3 million Dreamers eligible for deferred action contribute tax dollars to communities that help pay for schools, public infrastructure, and other services. Their contributions could be increased by taking steps to ensure that all individuals eligible for deferred action are enrolled, or even by offering a path to citizenship. Conversely, stripping their temporary lawful status or deporting them would decrease their tax contributions and deprive our country of a dedicated and diverse generation.An ITEP report from March 2017 found the 11 million undocumented immigrants living and working in the United States contribute more than $11.74 billion in state and local taxes.[iv] This report specifically examines the state and local tax contributions of undocumented immigrants who are currently enrolled or immediately eligible for DACA and the fiscal implications of various policy changes. The report includes information on the national impact (Chart 1) and provides a state-by-state breakdown (Appendices 1 and 2).Key Findings How Dreamers Contribute to State and Local Revenue
Questions have frequently been raised about the taxes paid by undocumented immigrants. Everyone living and working in the U.S. contributes to state and local taxes, regardless of their immigration status. We all pay sales and excise taxes when we purchase goods and services, such as clothing or gasoline. We all pay property taxes either directly for our homes or indirectly as renters.DACA provides young immigrants with work authorization and recipients are subject to the same state and local personal income tax laws as all lawfully present workers. Additionally, DACA recipients have (temporary) Social Security numbers. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that working DACA recipients file and pay state and local income taxes just like any other working American. As ITEP’s 2017 report demonstrated, about half of undocumented immigrants of all ages file income tax returns. They do this using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) in the absence of having valid Social Security numbers. Therefore we assume that young immigrants who are eligible for but not enrolled in DACA comply with income tax law at a similar rate.The tax revenues generated by DACA recipients are further boosted by the fact that DACA status boosts employment rates and wages. A national survey of DACA recipients found that employment rates increased by 127 percent after enrollment, from 44 percent of respondents employed to 91 percent.[vii]  Evidence also shows that relief from deportation and temporary work permits through programs like DACA also boosts undocumented immigrants’ wages by at least 8.5 percent. When given the opportunity to work legally and a reprieve from deportation DACA recipients are able to work more, earn more wages, and are less likely to be victims of wage theft from unscrupulous employers.Based on this evidence, we assume that 91 percent of the 682,000 young immigrants currently enrolled in DACA are employed, and that they are earning, on average, 8.5 percent more than the estimated 643,000 young people eligible for but not receiving DACA. The higher earnings, higher employment rate, and higher tax compliance rate of individuals enrolled in DACA leads to their increased tax contributions and higher effective tax rate compared to those eligible for but not receiving DACA. The total contributions of all Dreamers who are currently receiving or eligible for DACA status is over $1.7 billion in state and local taxes annually. If all eligible individuals were enrolled in DACA, those state and local tax contributions would increase by more than $815 million due to higher earnings, higher employment rate, and 100 percent tax compliance for all DACA eligible immigrants (see Table 1).In contrast, failing to maintain work authorizations and deportation relief of DACA would hurt state and local coffers. If the 682,000 young immigrants currently enrolled lost the protections of DACA, it would reduce their state and local tax contributions by nearly $700 million (see Table 1).ConclusionEvery state benefits from the tax contributions of young undocumented immigrants, but every state has much more to lose if we remove the protections and work authorization granted to these young people. On average, DACA recipients were only 6 years old when they were brought to this country. DACA recipients are part of the American family and over 70 percent have a U.S. citizen spouse, child, or sibling.[viii] Dreamers are our neighbors, classmates, and co-workers, and they have called this country home for most of their lives.  In its attempt to rescind DACA and increased detention and deportation enforcement, the Trump administration has broken a promise America made with these young people. If the Trump administration continues on this path, the nation risks forcing Dreamers back into the shadows and losing the economic and societal contributions these engaged young people are making in our communities.MethodologyITEP estimates the state and local tax contributions of DACA-eligible immigrants under different policy options through the methodology detailed below.This is a very conservative estimate. A 2017 nationally representative survey found the average annual income of working DACA recipients to be $36,231 while their average annual income prior to enrollment was $20,068. This represents an 81% increase in wages.[xiii]ITEP’s microsimulation computer model is a sophisticated program that applies the state and local tax laws in each state (including sales, excise, income, and property tax laws) to a statistically valid database of tax returns to generate estimates of the effective tax rates paid by taxpayers at various income levels under state and local tax law in place as of December 31, 2014. In January of 2015, ITEP released the 5th edition of Who Pays? which estimates the effect of the state and local tax laws as of January 2015 on taxpayers at 2012 income levels. This report applies effective tax rates calculated in the 2015 Who Pays? report to the DACA eligible population.The following assumptions were made to calculate the sales and excise, income, and property taxes of the undocumented immigration population:[i] “Approximate Active DACA Recipients as of January 31, 2018.” United States Citizenship and Immigration Services(USCIS), https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/DACA_Population_Data_Jan_31_2018.pdf

Note: the previous version of this report cited the effective tax rates paid after subtracting the federal deduction for state and local taxes, or federal offset. After the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the federal offset is almost non-existent. Thus, the most appropriate effective tax rate to reference is without deducting the federal offset.

Find out more from our 2017 Annual Report.June 26, 2014The essential economy—which encompasses the food services and hospitality industries, construction, agriculture, elder care, and manufacturing—is fundamental to the U.S. economy and society as a whole.[1] Immigrants’ participation in these sectors creates new jobs for native-born workers, contributes to the growth of construction and agriculture, and provides essential care to the United States’ aging population. This fact sheet—the tenth in our series on immigrants and the economy—details five reasons why immigrants are vital to the success of the essential economy.1. Immigrants play a critical role in supporting the food service and hospitality industries by meeting labor market demand and creating jobs as small-business owners. 2. Immigrants are supporting growth of the construction industry—a key measure of how well the economy is bouncing back from the Great Recession.3. With demand for produce at an all-time high, agriculture workers—nearly three-fourths of whom are foreign-born—are essential to getting food from our farms to our supermarkets.[16] 4. With a rapidly aging U.S. population, immigrants help to meet the increasing demand for in-home health aids and assisted living for seniors.5. Immigrants play an outsize role in the manufacturing industry, keeping middle-class jobs in the U.S. and helping to revitalize declining economies across the country.This fact sheet is a product of the AS/COA Immigration and Integration Initiative, which promotes positive dialogue around the economic contributions of immigrants across the United States. It was produced by Rebecca Bintrim and Adam Wolsky in collaboration with Kate Brick and Richard André, co-directors of the Immigration and Integration Initiative.

Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your WorldWhy does the crime rate soar among second-generation immigrants compared with their foreign-born peers?  Until recently, most sociologists have explained this increase by noting that many second-generation immigrants feel caught between two conflicting worlds—the old world of their parents and the new world of their birth.But recently researchers have posited an alternate theory:  Second-generation immigrants are just “catching up” with the rest of us, claims Bianca E. Bersani, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.Call it the dark side of assimilation. These second-generation immigrants have become as susceptible to temptation and harmful influences as are other Americans according to Bersani.  The unhappy consequence is a similar likelihood of committing a crime, Bersani wrote in an article published online by the journal Crime & Delinquency.Other studies have documented how second-generation immigrants have become more like the typical American, both in positive and negative ways. For example, a Pew Research Center analysis of Census data earlier this year found that median family income of second-generation immigrants is virtually identical to the national median and higher than their foreign-born counterparts.  Home ownership rates follow a similar trajectory.In her study, Bersani analyzed crime data collected from first- and second-generation immigrants. She then compared those crime rates with the other native-born adults and found striking similarities between second-generation immigrants and native-born non-Hispanic whites.She begins her analysis by noting this well-documented phenomenon:  The crime rate among first-generation immigrants—those who came to this country from somewhere else—is significantly lower than the overall crime rate and that of the second generation. It’s even lower for those in their teens and early 20s, the age range when criminal involvement peaks.But just a generation later, the crime rate soars.  In fact, it is virtually identical to the rate among native-born Americans across the most crime-prone years.  As the accompanying chart taken from an earlier Bersani study shows, about a quarter of 16-year-old native-born and second-generation immigrants have committed a crime in the past year. In contrast, about 17% of the foreign-born 16-year olds have broken the law.What explains the difference?Some researchers say the generations face two different sets of experiences, with the second generation—those with at least one parent who was born abroad—caught in the middle. They argue the second generation is caught between conflicting family and social values and expectations, and one result of this old world/new world conflict is a greater propensity to commit crime.  For more details, see this 1992 study.To explore the causes of crime among second-generation immigrants, Besani used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, a household-based, representative sample of people living in the U.S. in 1997 who were born from 1980 through 1984. The initial sample includes 8,984 youth who have been interviewed on an annual basis beginning in 1997. The dataset she used contained data collected through 2005.The survey questioned respondents on sensitive topics, including the number of times they had a purposely damaged or destroyed property, committed a theft, sold or helped to sell drugs, attacked someone with the intent of hurting them or got into a serious fight in the past year.In addition to crime data, the survey included information on important risk factors that researchers say are closely correlated with criminal involvement. They included whether the respondent had been a victim of a crime as a youth, various measures of family attachment as well as performance and attachment to school, whether the respondent had delinquent peers, lived in a neighborhood with gangs, or whether any of the respondent’s peers were gang members.Then Bersani compared second-generation immigrants with other native-born groups. She found that the results supported her theory that “their involvement in crime is the result of the same factors that explain involvement in crime among typical native-born youth.”For example, having peers in a gang increased the probability that an individual had been arrested in the previous year by 23% for second-generation immigrants and 25% for native-born non-Hispanic whites, Bersani wrote in an email. Similarly, having delinquent peers increases the likelihood of criminal or delinquent behavior by 6% for both groups. (The pattern was more mixed between second-generation immigrants and native-born blacks and Hispanics.)This similar offending “profile” is strong evidence, she argues, that the generation crime gap among immigrants is due to the second-generation behaving like their native-born peers and not only as a consequence of growing up in two colliding worlds.“Second generation immigrants appear to be catching-up to and resemble the typical native-born (white) population, at least in regard to their offending profile,” she wrote. These findings “suggest that the children of immigrants seemingly fall prey to criminogenic influences in similar ways that native-born youth do.”

Who you believe he was referring to probably depends on how you feel about President Trump. Trump and the White House claim it’s clear as day: Trump was obviously referring to MS-13 gang members who commit heinous crimes. Trump’s called MS-13 “animals” before, but after this controversy the White House has embraced the term: a Monday press release was titled “What You Need To Know About The Animals Of MS-13.”MS-13 “animals” has gone from a presidential utterance to White House doctrine. This WH press release on “what you need to know about the violent animals of MS-13” calls them animals 8 times. pic.twitter.com/ZAfOlYjaDBBut in the eyes of Trump’s critics, the justification for “animals” wasn’t obvious at all. Some believe that the president simply had an obligation to be more careful with his words, while others point to a long history of using a few criminals to smear entire groups of people — or simply claim that it’s inhumane to refer to any human being as an animal.At this point, both sides think they’ve won. Trump and the White House are messaging the idea that MS-13 is a bunch of animals in the aggressive manner they use when they think they’ve found a winning culture-war argument (see also: “Merry Christmas”). Meanwhile, Democrats and advocates appear to believe that they have another remark on their hands that will pay political dividends by revealing the president’s true animosity toward people of color (see also: “shithole countries”). Both sides believe that the other is missing, or deliberately blocking out, the context of Trump’s remark. It’s an intractable disagreement not because the immediate context is unknowable — the whole event was broadcast live — but because Donald Trump has spent his entire three years in national politics saying things that sound racist to a lot of people, and America has spent three years arguing about whether that’s the fault of the person speaking those words or the people hearing them.

  The original wave of progressive outrage over Trump’s comments, on Wednesday, was spurred by tweets like this one, which quoted Trump’s “animals” comment but not the comment from the sheriff that preceded it:Trump: "We're taking people out of the country — you wouldn't believe how bad these people are. These aren't people. These are animals."He says the U.S. has "the dumbest laws on immigration in the world."That outrage spurred characterization of Trump’s comments as being about all deportees or even about all unauthorized immigrants. Trump’s defenders immediately claimed the media was getting the story wrong — that Trump had been answering a question about MS-13, so he clearly meant only that violent MS-13 gang members were “criminals.”Both of those characterizations were wrong. This is a pasted selection from the transcript sent out by the White House Press Office after the roundtable Wednesday:SHERIFF (Margaret) MIMS (Fresno County, CA): Now ICE is the only law enforcement agency that cannot use our databases to find the bad guys. They cannot come in and talk to people in our jail, unless they reach a certain threshold. They can’t do all kinds of things that other law enforcement agencies can do. And it’s really put us in a very bad position.THE PRESIDENT: It’s a disgrace. Okay? It’s a disgrace.SHERIFF MIMS: It’s a disgrace.THE PRESIDENT: And we’re suing on that, and we’re working hard, and I think it will all come together, because people want it to come together. It’s so ridiculous. The concept that we’re even talking about is ridiculous. We’ll take care of it, Margaret. We’ll win.SHERIFF MIMS: Thank you. There could be an MS-13 member I know about — if they don’t reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about it.THE PRESIDENT: We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It’s crazy.This context makes a few things clear.First of all, Trump was not asked a question about MS-13. He was not asked a question at all. He was commiserating with Sheriff Mims about the restrictions that the California “sanctuary” law puts on the ability of local law enforcement officers to make decisions about when someone should be flagged to ICE.Second of all, the context in which MS-13 was mentioned was itself very specific: someone identified by the sheriff’s department as a “known” gang member but who doesn’t meet the “threshold” of being charged with or convicted of a serious crime. Third, Trump’s response to Mims’s comment wasn’t actually a response to the point she was making. It wasn’t about people in local jails in the US. He first referred to people “trying to come in” to the country and then to people who are being “taken out of the country.” He then launched into a complaint about bad US laws that allow people to reenter the country repeatedly — something that also has nothing to do with the complaint Mims was making.In context, Trump’s “animals” comment was simply part of a riff; something at best tangentially related to the conversation that he and Mims had been having up to that point. That riff may well have been inspired by Mims’s reference to MS-13 in her previous remark. At the same time, though, Trump manifestly wasn’t talking about the same people Mims was talking about: MS-13 members in American jails without serious criminal records. The president often does this. His comments in unscripted settings often fail to follow any obvious train of thought; he often goes off on tangents and rehashes old riffs; he often fails to demonstrate an understanding of the actual policies being discussed. This is why “what did he mean” is so often an open question. But because he’s the president of the United States, ambiguous statements can’t be left ambiguous — they’re going to acquire whatever meaning people can make from them, based on their existing understanding of what kind of person the president is.To people who are more skeptical of the “mainstream media” than they are of the president, the coverage of the president’s remarks seemed like a clear-cut case of “fake news” — reporters taking Trump’s words out of context to make him sound like a racist when he was in fact talking about violent criminals. “I don’t think the term the president used was strong enough,” press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. “It took an animal to stab a man 100 times and decapitate him and cut his heart out.” And it inspired a wave of fact-checking and finger-wagging from media reporters themselves.The Trump critics who were initially outraged about Trump’s “animals” comment, however, see this entire conversation about the context of Wednesday’s exchange as more or less missing the point.They believe that Trump has shown a willingness to use racist language in the past and has demonstrated that he believes some people of color aren’t really human. Those facts, they believe, are more relevant context than what Sheriff Mims said at the roundtable. And they believe that in that context, it is foolish or even dangerous to present the “animals” remark as if there’s any ambiguity.This is the debate that has defined Donald Trump’s political career. His very first speech as a presidential candidate made a riffing reference to rapists and murderers crossing into the US, spurring outrage from immigrants and progressives that the president had called Mexicans and immigrants “criminals.” Trump gleefully exploited the outrage and parlayed it into a surge in the primary polls. Ever since, his most frequent and enthusiastic rhetorical theme has been that Americans are in danger from criminals coming into the US, and that his particular immigration agenda is the best way to stop them. This is why he keeps talking about MS-13; this is why he keeps dwelling on a few particularly gory crimes and calling the gang “animals.”Trump critics accuse him of labeling all immigrants (or all Latinos) criminals; his critics’ critics counter that he isn’t explicitly talking about all immigrants or all Latinos and that it’s liberals who think nonracial comments are about race.Every iteration of this fight encourages both sides’ viewpoints. It encourages Trump’s defenders — and those who are anti-anti-Trump — to believe that Trump’s words are being taken out of context to suit a preexisting narrative. It encourages Trump’s critics to believe that the president is deliberately engaging in dog-whistle politics because he knows exactly where the line is and how to tiptoe over it without admitting to doing so.The Trump administration won the public argument about whether Trump was, at least ostensibly, referring to MS-13 members. But that doesn’t resolve the argument over whether it was morally okay for him to do that.Indeed, to those who believe the most important point is that no one should ever be described as subhuman, attempts to explain the context of Trump’s remarks were seen as attempts to justify the dehumanization of some people as long as they’re accused of being in a gang. It feels pretty weird watching folks on this website debate who should and shouldn't be described as less than human by the president.On one level, this is a sheer argument of deontological ethics: All people are possessed of innate human dignity, and no act they commit can strip that of them or justify other people acting toward them as if they do not possess it. Most codes of ethics don’t allow people to treat others badly just because they have done bad things. Christianity makes a virtue of mercy and has its messiah tell a mob they are morally unfit to stone an adulteress (a violator of one of the Ten Commandments!) unless they are wholly without sin.On another level, though, this is an instrumental argument that dehumanizing anyone leads to bad outcomes. An entire academic literature is dedicated to the pernicious effects of dehumanizing language; an oversimplified version of that literature, often expressed during the “animals” debate, is that dehumanization of a particular scapegoat group is a necessary component of totalitarian rhetoric. (The implication was often that comments like Trump’s are always a precursor to genocidal violence, which doesn’t hold logically.) More specifically, as criminologist John Pfaff pointed out, a willingness to accept criminals as subhuman encourages law enforcement officers to treat them accordingly, with often horrific results.The people making this argument weren’t primarily Democratic politicians. But after a day or so of the animals debate, Republicans had shifted to the idea that they had jiujitsued liberals into defending MS-13, and that that would help them in November. This, too, is a fixture of dialogue in the age of Trump: even people who wouldn’t defend his statements on the merits believe that they create an advantageous political situation for his party by inspiring the other side to do something politically counterproductive.It seems logical that MS-13 is inherently a winning issue for Trump and a losing one for Democrats (though it’s worth noting that in the one post-Trump race where the tie between immigration and crime was central to the campaign, the Virginia gubernatorial election, the Democrat won).But it’s another example of people talking past each other. No one is saying that it is politically useful to adopt the message of “Trump was just talking about violent MS-13 criminals, but they are people too.” Trump’s critics are either emphasizing that it is true that MS-13 members are also human beings or making the argument that Trump doesn’t really just mean MS-13 members when he says “animals.”The problem with fighting about whom Trump meant when he said what he said is that, on a policy level, what he said does not actually matter.His administration is not focusing on deporting people who have committed particularly heinous crimes, gang members, or people with criminal records. From Trump’s inauguration to the end of 2017, ICE arrested 45,436 immigrants without criminal records.On Thursday, in the midst of the furor over the “animals” comments, ICE released new data for the first three months of 2018 — showing that an additional 13,300 immigrants without criminal records were arrested from January to March.To be sure, ICE arrests of immigrants with criminal records ticked up slightly from the last year of the Obama administration (in which immigration enforcement was subdued compared to previous years) to the Trump administration. But arrests of immigrants without criminal records have also spiked. During President Obama’s last year, about 16 percent of ICE arrests were of noncriminal immigrants; each month since July 2017, between 32 and 40 percent of arrestees have been noncriminals.The Trump administration is still deporting fewer noncriminal immigrants than the Obama administration did circa 2011, and the proportion of deportees who are noncriminals is usually smaller than the proportion of arrestees who are. But the Trump administration is aiming to not just ramp back up to the deportation peak of Obama’s first term but surpass it, and that’s going to require arresting and deporting a lot of immigrants without criminal records.If Trump understands his own administration’s policy, he’s never acknowledged it in public. He sticks to the same rhetorical move every time: refer to some specific criminals, call them horrible people and animals, say that their evil justifies his immigration policy, and allow the conflation of all immigrants and all Latinos with criminals and animals to remain subtext.This isn’t unique to Trump. An entire era of American criminal justice policy was defined by this rhetorical move: Politicians attacked each other over horrific cases of leniency gone wrong, or with the threat of child “superpredators” roaming the streets, and the fear of those “worst of the worst” criminals led to policies that swept millions of people into the criminal justice system.As Trump has amped up his rhetoric about MS-13, local and federal law enforcement officials have started rounding up immigrant teens on the basis of suspected gang membership — no matter how dubious those claims are. In a 2017 feature about MS-13 and Long Island’s immigrant community, Jonathan Blitzer of the New Yorker says that one Long Island teen was arrested in a gang sweep for having a Salvadoran flag as his profile picture (whose dominant color, bright blue, is also used by MS-13). One ex-girlfriend of a gang member told Blitzer that when they needed to lie low, “Carlos and his friends from MS-13 would change their style of dress” — like swapping out their shoes — and then “mocked the police for being slow to catch on” to the fact that they weren’t wearing their “characteristic” gang attire. “Immigrant teens without ties to the gang,” meanwhile, were at risk: They “didn’t necessarily know which clothes were off limits.”In one high-profile case from 2017, ICE agents made several attempts to strip protections from an immigrant covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by claiming he was a gang member; the immigrant, however, claims that the ICE agents falsified a document to make it look like he admitted to being in a gang (and federal judges have believed him).These things don’t just happen because Donald Trump uses the word “animals.” But they don’t get the attention that Trump’s words do. And while plenty of people are willing to defend calling gang members “animals,” few are interested in looking at whether the immigration enforcement system as it exists draws the clear distinction they claim to have heard from Trump.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.The story of the first generation Ghanian-American student accepted by all eight Ivy league schools is wonderful, but it also stirs up the tension between black Americans and recent African immigrants — especially when you describe him as "not a typical African-American kid." This article is from the archive of our partner .The story of the first-generation Ghanian-American student accepted by all eight Ivy league schools is wonderful, but it also stirs up the tension between black Americans and recent African immigrants — especially when you describe him as "not a typical African-American kid." That's been the reaction to USA Today's profile on Kwasi Enin, a Long Island high schooler who got into the nation's most competitive schools through hard work and, according to IvyWise CEO Katherine Cohen, being African (and being male). At one point the piece reads:Being a first-generation American from Ghana also helps him stand out, Cohen says. "He's not a typical African-American kid.""Not a typical African-American kid" is being read as an allusion to the lazy black American stereotype. The tension comes from the fact that some African immigrants buy into that stereotype, which gets turned into "Africans don't like black people." This has almost nothing to do with Enin, who is obviously a remarkable young man, and everything to do with how America perceives and portrays black Americans and African immigrants. In January, Luvvie Ajayi, a Nigerian-born immigrant, tried to explain "akata," a word some Nigerians use to refer to black Americans that translates into wild animal. (Note: A lot of Nigerians use akata to mean "ghetto" as well. My mom once told me I was dressed like an akata girl because I wanted to wear sweatpants in public.) She argued in a series of tweets, collected by Clutch, that the reason some Africans believe black Americans should be doing better is because they don't know about the history of black Americans but see their own success as a reason blacks should excel as well. "Africans who come to the U.S. are statistically more successful than African Americans and they think 'if I could do it, why not them?'" she wrote. American society holds that same view as well. A 2007 study covered by the Washington Post found that a quarter of black students admitted to elite colleges were African immigrants, though they only represented 13 percent of America's college-age black population. The study's authors several theories on why black immigrants do better, including "to white observers black immigrants seem more polite, less hostile, more solicitous and 'easier to get along with.' Native blacks are perceived in precisely the opposite fashion." Lani Guinier, a Harvard professor, argued instead that schools were attempting to "resolve historic wrongs against native black Americans by enrolling immigrants who look like them" but had different experiences. "In part, it has to do with coming from a country ... where blacks were in the majority and did not experience the stigma that black children did in the United States," Guinier said. Either explanation creates a divide — as if Africans can only succeed at the expense of black Americans, or vice versa.This article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.We want to hear what you think about this article.

(Photo: Thomas Dwyer)Immigration seems to be ever present in current political and public debate in the United States, with the topic central in the 2016 presidential campaign and since then, amid ongoing policy conversations about border wall construction, refugee resettlement cuts, family separation, and much more. Yet even as positions taken by political parties and individuals seem hardened, immigration flows and the makeup of the U.S. immigrant population have been changing in significant, though not always fully appreciated, ways.Among the changes: The overall immigrant population continues to grow, but at a slower rate than before the 2007-09 recession. Recent immigrants are more likely to be from Asia than from Mexico, and are also more likely to have a college degree. The size of the unauthorized population appears to be on the decline. Deportations from within the United States are rising. And the United States in 2018 resettled the smallest number of refugees since formal creation of the refugee resettlement program in 1980.To help inform discussions around immigration, this Spotlight offers in one accessible resource the most authoritative, unbiased, and current data available about the 44.5 million immigrants resident in the United States as of 2017. By compiling some of the most frequently requested facts and figures, this article provides answers to questions such as: What are the trends shaping immigration to our country? How many people have immigrated to the United States, and via what channels? How many arrived as refugees, and from which countries? Has the number of unauthorized immigrants changed in recent years? What jobs do immigrants fill? And how many U.S. residents are either immigrants or the children of immigrants?The article draws on the most recent resources and data from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI); the U.S. Census Bureau (using its 2017 American Community Survey [ACS], 2018 Current Population Survey [CPS], and 2000 decennial census); and the U.S. Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and State. (Note: DHS and State Department data refer to fiscal years that begin on October 1 and end on September 30; ACS and CPS data refer to calendar years). For more detailed information on U.S. and global immigration data sources and one-click access to these datasets, see the MPI report Immigration Data Matters.Click on the bullet points for more information on each topic:How many immigrants reside in the United States?More than 44.5 million immigrants resided in the United States in 2017, the historical high since census records have been kept. One in seven U.S. residents is foreign born, according to 2017 American Community Survey (ACS) data. While immigrants’ current share—13.7 percent—of the overall U.S. population (325.7 million people) has been increasing since the record low marked in 1970, it remains below the historical record of 14.8 percent hit in 1890.Between 2016 and 2017, the foreign-born population increased by about 787,000, or almost 2 percent—a rate higher than the 1 percent growth experienced between 2015 and 2016, but lower than the 3 percent increase between 2013 and 2014.How have the number and share of immigrants changed over time?Data on the nativity of the U.S. population was first collected in the 1850 census. That year, there were 2.2 million immigrants, representing nearly 10 percent of the overall population.Between 1860 and 1920, the immigrant share fluctuated between 13 percent and almost 15 percent of the overall population, peaking at 14.8 percent in 1890, largely due to high levels of immigration from Europe.Restrictive immigration laws in 1921 and 1924—which kept the channels to permanent immigration open almost exclusively to northern and western European immigrants—coupled with the Great Depression and World War II, led to a sharp drop in new arrivals from the Eastern Hemisphere. The foreign-born share steadily declined, hitting a record low of 4.7 percent in 1970 (9.6 million; see Figure 1).Since then, the share and number of immigrants have increased rapidly, mainly because of large-scale immigration from Latin America and Asia, with the foreign-born population standing at 44.5 million as of 2017. Important shifts in U.S. immigration law (including the Immigration Act of 1965 that abolished national-origin admission quotas, the Refugee Act of 1980, and preferential treatment of Cuban immigrants); the United States’ growing economic and military presence in Asia and Latin America; economic ties, powerful immigrant networks, and deep migration history between the United States and its southern neighbors; and major economic transformations and political instability in countries around the world all have helped usher in the vast diversification of immigration flows.Figure 1. Size and Share of the Foreign-Born Population in the United States, 1850-2017Source: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) tabulation of data from U.S. Census Bureau, 2010-17 American Community Surveys (ACS), and 1970, 1990, and 2000 Decennial Census. All other data are from Campbell J. Gibson and Emily Lennon, "Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-Born Population of the United States: 1850 to 1990" (Working Paper no. 29., U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC, 1999).Definitions"Foreign born" and "immigrant" are used interchangeably and refer to persons with no U.S. citizenship at birth. This population includes naturalized citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees and asylees, persons on certain temporary visas, and the unauthorized.Geographical regions: MPI follows the definition of Latin America as put forth by the United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau, which spans Central America (including Mexico), the Caribbean, and South America. For more information about geographical regions, see the U.S. Census Bureau and United Nations Statistics Division.How do today’s top countries of origin compare to those 50 years ago?In 2017, Mexicans accounted for approximately 25 percent of immigrants in the United States, making them by far the largest foreign-born group. Indians and Chinese (including immigrants from Hong Kong but not Taiwan) were the next two largest groups, each comprising close to 6 percent, followed by Filipinos at 5 percent. Rounding out the top ten were El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic (about 3 percent each); and South Korea and Guatemala (approximately 2 percent). Together, these countries were the origin for 57 percent of the U.S. immigrant population in 2017.The predominance of Latin American and Asian immigration in the late 20th and early 21st centuries starkly contrasts with the trend in the mid-1900s, when immigrants were largely European. In the 1960s no single country accounted for more than 15 percent of the total immigrant population. Italians were the top origin group, making up 13 percent of the foreign born in 1960, followed by Germans and Canadians (about 10 percent each).How many immigrants have entered the United States since 2010, and what are the leading sending countries?Twenty-one percent of the 44.5 million immigrants in the United States in 2017 entered in 2010 or later, 26 percent arrived between 2000 and 2009, 22 percent between 1990 and 1999, and 31 percent before 1990.While immigrants from Mexico dominated the flows post-1970, the makeup of newcomers has changed since the 2007-09 recession. Recently arrived immigrants are more likely to come from Asia, with India and China leading the way. Countries such as the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela have also seen sizeable emigration to the United States. By contrast, there were fewer Mexican immigrants in the United States in 2017 than in 2010, representing the biggest decline of all immigrant groups.How many U.S. residents are of recent immigrant origin?Immigrants and their U.S.-born children now number approximately 89.4 million people, or 28 percent of the overall U.S. population, according to the 2018 Current Population Survey (CPS). Pew Research Center projects that the immigrant-origin share will rise to about 36 percent by 2065.DefinitionsCollege-educated persons are defined as adults 25 years and older with a bachelor's degree or higher.The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects the race or races with which individuals most closely self-identify. Race categories include both racial and national-origin groups.Hispanic and Latino are ethnic, not racial, categories. They include individuals who classified themselves in one of the specific Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino categories listed on the Census 2000 questionnaire—"Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban"—as well as those who indicate that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino."Persons who indicated that they are "other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino" include those whose origins are from Spain, the Spanish-speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican Republic, or people who self-identify more generally as Spanish, Spanish-American, Hispanic, Hispano, Latino, and so on.Read more about Census Bureau definitions here.What is the median age for immigrants?Overall, the immigrant population in 2017 was older than the U.S.-born population, with a median age of 44.8 years as compared to 36.2 years for the native born. The latter are younger largely because most children of immigrants are born in the United States and a significant share are under age 18.In 2017, fewer than 1 percent of immigrants were under age 5 (compared to 7 percent for the native born), approximately 5 percent were ages 5 to 17 (versus 18 percent), 79 percent were ages 18 to 64 (compared to 59 percent), and 16 percent were ages 65 and older (the same as the U.S. born).What is the female share of the immigrant population?
In 2017, approximately 52 percent of immigrants were female. The share has fluctuated slightly over the past four decades; women accounted for 53 percent of immigrants in 1980, 51 percent in 1990, 50 percent in 2000, and 51 percent in 2010.What is the racial makeup of immigrants?Forty-six percent of immigrants in 2017 reported their race as single-race White, 27 percent as Asian, 9 percent as Black, and 16 percent as some other race. About 2 percent reported having two or more races.How many immigrants are Hispanic or Latino?In 2017, 44 percent of U.S. immigrants (19.7 million people) reported having Hispanic or Latino origins.Note: The Census Bureau classifies Hispanic and Latino as ethnic categories, separate from the racial categories listed above (see Definitions box for more information).How many Hispanics in the United States are immigrants?The majority of U.S. Hispanics are native born. Of the 58.8 million people in 2017 who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, 34 percent (19.7 million) were immigrants and 66 percent (39.1 million) were native-born.Which languages are most frequently spoken at home?In 2017, approximately 78 percent (239.3 million) of the 306 million people ages 5 and older in the United States reported speaking only English at home.The remaining 22 percent (66.5 million) reported speaking a language other than English at home. Of the top languages, Spanish was by far the most common (62 percent), followed by Chinese (5 percent, including Mandarin and Cantonese), Tagalog (almost 3 percent), and Vietnamese, Arabic, French (including Cajun), and Korean (about 2 percent each). The remaining languages in the top 15 each accounted for approximately 1 percent: Russian, German, Haitian Creole, Hindi, Portuguese, Italian, Polish, and Urdu.What percentage of immigrants are Limited English Proficient?In 2017, approximately 48 percent (21.2 million) of 44.2 million immigrants ages 5 and older were Limited English Proficient (LEP).Immigrants account for 82 percent of all LEP individuals over age 5, while native-born individuals account for 18 percent.Note: The term "Limited English Proficient" refers to persons ages 5 and older who reported speaking English "not at all," "not well," or "well" on their survey questionnaire. Individuals who reported speaking “only English” or speaking English "very well" are considered proficient in English.What share of the immigrant population has a college education?In 2017, 31 percent (12 million) of the 39 million immigrants ages 25 and older had a bachelor's degree or higher, compared to 32 percent of U.S.-born adults (see Figure 2). Notably, the share of college-educated immigrants was much higher—47 percent—among those who entered the country in the previous five years (between 2012 and 2017).Figure 2. Educational Attainment of U.S.-Born, Immigrant, and Recently Arrived Immigrant Residents, 2017Source: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS.Educational attainment varies by country of origin. In 2017, the top five countries of origin for immigrants with a bachelor’s degree or more were India (79 percent), Taiwan (72 percent), Egypt (68 percent), Latvia (67 percent), and Kuwait (65 percent).Which states have the largest number of immigrants and which ones have experienced the fastest growth of their immigrant populations?In 2017, the top five U.S. states by number of immigrants were California (10.7 million), Texas (4.9 million), New York (4.5 million), Florida (4.4 million), and New Jersey (2.1 million).When classified by the share of immigrants out of the total state population, the top five states in 2017 were California (27 percent), New York (23 percent), New Jersey (23 percent), Florida (21 percent), and Nevada (20 percent).While traditional immigrant destinations lead in terms of absolute number of new immigrants, other states have seen much larger relative growth in their immigrant populations (see Table 1).Table 1. Top Five States by Absolute and Percent Growth in Immigrant Population, 1990-2000 and 2000-17Note: In some states, the initial foreign-born population was quite small. Thus, relatively small absolute increases in the immigrant population in these states have translated into high percent growthSource: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS and 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census.Definitions"Civilian labor force"—civilian persons ages 16 and older who were either employed or unemployed but looking for work in the week prior to participation in the American Community Survey or decennial census.How many immigrants are in the U.S. civilian labor force?Immigrants accounted for 17 percent (28 million) of the 163.7 million persons in the civilian labor force in 2017. Between 1970 and 2017, the percentage of the foreign born in the labor force more than tripled, from 5 percent to 17 percent. Over the same period, the foreign-born share of the total population grew more slowly: from less than 5 percent to just under 14 percent.What types of jobs do immigrants hold?Of the 26.8 million employed foreign-born workers ages 16 and older in 2017, the largest share, more than 32 percent, worked in management, professional, and related occupations. See Figure 3 for other occupations.Figure 3. Employed Workers in the Civilian Labor Force (ages 16 and older), by Nativity and Occupation, 2017Note: Numbers may not add up to 100 as they are rounded to the nearest whole number.Source: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS.What share of immigrants have health insurance?In 2017, approximately 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance (compared to 69 percent of the U.S. born), and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage (compared to 36 percent of the native born).Since implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, health insurance coverage has improved for both the U.S. born and immigrants. From 2013 to 2017, the immigrant uninsured rate fell from 32 percent to 20 percent, and the rate for the native born fell from 12 percent to 7 percent.Note: Health insurance coverage is calculated only for the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Since some people may simultaneously hold both private and public health insurance coverage, estimates of those with public health insurance and those with public coverage may overlap. Their sum therefore may be greater than the total number of people with health insurance.Definitions"Second-generation immigrant children"—any U.S.-born child with at least one foreign-born parent. 
"First-generation immigrant children"—any foreign-born child with at least one foreign-born parent. 
"Child with immigrant parents"—both first- and second-generation immigrant children. Note: The estimates in this section include only children under age 18 who reside with at least one parent.How many U.S. children live with immigrant parents?In 2017, approximately 18.2 million children under age 18 lived with at least one immigrant parent. They accounted for 26 percent of the 70 million children under age 18 in the United States, up from 13 percent in 1990 and 19 percent in 2000.Second-generation children—born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent—accounted for 88 percent (16 million) of all children under age 18 with immigrant parents. The remaining 12 percent (2.2 million) were born outside the United States.How has the number of children in immigrant families changed over time?Between 1990 and 2000, the number of children ages 17 and under with immigrant parents grew 60 percent, from 8.2 million to 13.1 million. Between 2000 and 2017, the number grew by another 39 percent, from 13.1 million to 18.2 million.The population of first-generation immigrant children grew by 43 percent between 1990 and 2000 (from 1.9 million to 2.7 million), but then declined 19 percent between 2000 and 2017 (from 2.7 million to 2.2 million).In contrast, the number of second-generation immigrant children has grown steadily since 1990. Between 1990 and 2000, the number increased by 65 percent (from 6.3 million to 10.4 million). Between 2000 and 2017, this population grew 54 percent (from 10.4 million to almost 16 million).How many children living with immigrant parents are in low-income families?In 2017, there were 27.4 million children under age 18 living in low-income families (i.e., with family incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty threshold). Of them, 8.8 million (or 32 percent) were children of immigrants.Which states have the largest number of children in immigrant families and which ones have experienced the fastest growth of this population?In 2017, the top five states by the total number of children under age 18 living with immigrant parents were California (4.1 million), Texas (2.5 million), New York (1.5 million), Florida (1.4 million), and New Jersey (767,000). These states accounted for 56 percent of the 18.2 million children with immigrant parents residing in the United States.In terms of the share of children with immigrant parents, the top five states in 2017 were California (48 percent of all children in the state), New Jersey (40 percent), Nevada (38 percent), New York (37 percent), and Texas (35 percent).While traditional immigrant destinations experience the largest absolute growth in children with immigrant parents, other states have seen much larger relative growth (see Table 2).Table 2. Top Five States by Absolute and Percent Growth in Children with Immigrant Parents, 1990-2000 and 2000-17Note: In some states, the initial number of children with immigrant parents was quite small. Thus, relatively small absolute increases in the immigrant population in these states have translated into high percent growth.Source: MPI tabulation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau 2017 ACS and 1990 and 2000 Decennial Census.How many immigrants obtained lawful permanent residence (aka getting a green card) in 2017?In fiscal year (FY) 2017, 1.1 million immigrants became lawful permanent residents (LPRs), also known as green-card holders. The number of new LPRs in 2017 decreased by 5 percent from 2016 (1.2 million). In the past decade, the number of new LPRs annually has ranged from 991,000 (2013) to 1.2 million (2016).In recent years, green-card holders have been roughly evenly divided between those already living in the United States who are adjusting their status and those applying from outside the country. Almost half (49 percent, or 549,000) of the 1.1 million new LPRs in 2017 received green cards from within the United States. Many of these new permanent residents are spouses, minor children, and parents of U.S. citizens; or persons who arrived as refugees or as temporary workers.A slightly higher number of new LPRs (578,000, or 51 percent) were persons granted this status from abroad. The share of new arrivals rose steadily in the past decade from 41-42 percent in 2008-09, to 46-47 percent in 2013-14, and surpassing 50 percent in 2016. The majority of new arrivals are immediate family members of U.S. citizens and LPRs.Under which categories are permanent immigrants admitted?There are four main pathways to obtain a green card: through a family relationship, employment sponsorship, humanitarian protection (refugees and asylees), and the Diversity Visa (DV) lottery.Overall, of the 1.1 million immigrants who received green cards in 2017, 46 percent were immediate relatives of U.S. citizens (immediate relatives have unlimited annual visas), followed by another 21 percent of family-related immigrants (whose admission is limited by visa and country caps).Thirteen percent adjusted from refugee or asylee status. About 12 percent of LPRs were either sponsored by their employers or were able to self-sponsor, including investors. Roughly 5 percent were diversity lottery winners.What are the top five countries of birth for new permanent immigrants in 2017?The top five countries of birth were Mexico (15 percent), mainland China and Cuba (6 percent each), and India and the Dominican Republic (5 percent each). These countries represented about 38 percent of all persons who received green cards in 2017.How many people are selected in the Diversity Visa lottery and where do they come from?In 2017, 51,600 people received green cards as diversity immigrants (from countries with low rates of immigration), representing approximately 5 percent of the 1.1 million new LPRs.The leading countries of birth of DV immigrants were Nepal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Egypt, which each accounted for about 6 percent of DV immigrants; followed by Ethiopia, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Albania, with 5 percent each.For some countries, the diversity visa lottery represents a major share of all new LPRs. For example, among Algerians who received a green card in 2017, 62 percent did so via the green-card lottery. Shares were also high for Uzbekistan (58 percent) and Tajikistan (56 percent) and represented between 40 and 50 percent of LPRs born in Albania, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Togo, Sudan, Benin, and Moldova.Created in 1990, the lottery sets aside 55,000 diversity visas annually, of which 5,000 must be used for applicants under the Nicaraguan and Central America Relief Act of 1997. Interest in the lottery is significantly higher than there are available visas: About 14.7 million qualified applications were registered for the DV-2018, in total covering 23.1 million applicants, their spouses, and their minor children. The number registering in the DV-2018 was 61 percent higher than the 9.2 million registered for the DV-2009. (The application number varies each year depending on which countries are eligible.) Before receiving permission to immigrate, lottery winners must provide proof of a high school education or its equivalent or show two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience. They also must pass a medical exam and a background check.How many people have temporary visas?According to the most recently available Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates at the time of this writing, 2.3 million immigrants on various temporary visas resided in the United States during 2016, up from about 2 million in 2015. Almost half (1,100,000) were temporary workers and their families, followed by 870,000 foreign students and their families (40 percent).Sixty-one percent were from Asia. Nationals of countries in Europe and North America accounted for 15 percent each. The top five countries of origin—India, China, Mexico, Canada, and South Korea—accounted for 57 percent of all residents on temporary visas.Note: This estimate of temporary visa holders includes temporary workers, international students, exchange visitors, diplomats, and representatives of foreign governments and international organizations. It excludes tourists and other short-term visitors. North America includes Canada, Bermuda, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.How many people entered the United States on nonimmigrant visas? In 2016, 42.7 million individuals entered the United States as I-94 nonimmigrants on various temporary visas. On average, each I-94 nonimmigrant was admitted 1.8 times. This is the first time the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) estimated the number of unique individuals who came temporarily, as opposed to the number of nonimmigrant admissions or entries.Most of these nonimmigrants, 34.2 million, entered as tourists, followed by 3.7 million business visitors. Of these, 15 million tourists and 1.7 million business travelers were from Visa Waiver countries. Further, 1 million international students entered on F-1 visas. OIS estimated that additionally about 290,300 individuals were admitted on high-skilled worker H-1B visas (mostly from India, China, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Mexico) and 81,600 on nonagricultural temporary or seasonal worker H-2B visas (mostly from Mexico, Jamaica, Guatemala, South Africa, and Canada).How many nonimmigrant visas does the State Department issue?In FY 2018, the annual number of nonimmigrant visas issued by the State Department decreased for the third time to 9 million—a 7 percent decline from the 9.7 million issued in FY 2017.The Trump administration implemented a number of policies in 2017 and 2018 that could lead to a decline in admissions, including the travel ban barring individuals from certain countries from U.S. entry, lengthened visa application processes, and greater discretion for consular officers to deny visas. From FY 2015 to FY 2018, visa refusal rates for tourists and business travelers from travel-ban countries increased significantly: all applications from North Korea were denied, followed by Somalia (90 percent), Iran (88 percent), Yemen (83 percent), Syria (77 percent), and Libya and Venezuela (74 percent each). Furthermore, during the same period, visa refusal rates rose for visitors from some major non-travel ban countries, including Mexico (from 20 percent to 25 percent), mainland China (from 10 percent to 17 percent), and India (from 24 percent to 26 percent).Three-quarters of the 9 million nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2018 were temporary business and tourist visas (B and BCC visas).The next largest visa class was for academic students and exchange visitors and their family members (F and J visa categories), who comprised around 8 percent of all nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2018. The third largest group of nonimmigrant visas was given to temporary workers and trainees and their family members (H visa categories), who comprised 7 percent of nonimmigrant visas.Looking at the distribution of temporary visas issued in 2018 by region of origin, the largest shares were issued to nationals from Asia (43 percent), North America (22 percent, including Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean), and South America (18 percent). The remainder: Europe (12 percent), Africa (6 percent), and Oceania (0.7 percent).Note: The number of visas issued does not necessarily match the number of foreign nationals who entered the United States in the same year because some nonimmigrant visas may not be used.How many nonimmigrant admissions does DHS grant in a year? In total, DHS granted 181 million nonimmigrant admissions in 2017, of which 103 million were admissions of Canadians traveling for business or pleasure and Mexicans who possess a nonresident Border Crossing Card (i.e., laser visa). These travelers are exempt from completing the I-94 arrival/departure form at the port of entry, thus DHS does not provide characteristics for this group.In 2017, there were 77.6 million total temporary admissions of I-94 nonimmigrants, a slight uptick from 77.1 million in 2016. (See Table 3.)Table 3. Nonimmigrant Admissions by Category, FY 2017Source: DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2017.Note: Nonimmigrant admissions represent the number of entries. Individuals may have multiple entries within the year. OIS reports characteristics of nonimmigrants who must complete an I-94 arrival/departure form at entry.Notes on Refugees and AsyleesWhat is the difference between a refugee and an asylee? In the United States, the main difference is the person's location at the time of application. 
Refugees are nearly always outside of the United States when they are considered for resettlement, whereas asylum seekers submit their applications while physically present in or at a port of entry to the United States. Asylum seekers can submit an asylum request either affirmatively or defensively.The affirmative asylum process applies to persons who initially file an asylum application with USCIS as well as applicants who subsequently have their application referred by USCIS to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). The defensive asylum process applies to persons in removal proceedings who appear before EOIR and people who apply for asylum at U.S. borders and points of entry.How many refugees entered the United States, and where were they from?Every year, the president in consultation with Congress sets the annual refugee admissions ceiling and allocations by region of origin. For FY 2019, the annual ceiling was set at 30,000, the lowest since the program began in 1980.In FY 2018, 22,491 refugees were resettled in the United States, amounting to less than half of the admission ceiling of 45,000 allocated for that year—largely due to processing delays and policies put in place to increase vetting of refugees. This represents a 58 percent drop compared to the 53,716 admitted in 2017.The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Myanmar (also known as Burma), Ukraine, Bhutan, and Eritrea were the primary countries of nationality, accounting for 78 percent (17,565) of all refugees resettled in 2018. Rounding out the top ten were Afghanistan, El Salvador, Pakistan, Russia, and Ethiopia. Together, nationals of the top ten countries comprised 90 percent (20,349) of all refugee arrivals in 2018.Table 4. Top Ten Countries of Refugee Admissions by Nationality, FY 2018Source: MPI tabulation of Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS) data from the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.How many asylum applications were filed and where are asylum seekers from?In FY 2018, an estimated 106,147 affirmative asylum applications were received by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—25 percent fewer than the 141,695 in FY 2017. This is the first decline in application volume after eight years of growth. Applicants for affirmative asylum must be present in the United States, and do not include those seeking asylum through the defensive asylum process while in removal proceedings.Venezuela was the top country of origin for received affirmative asylum applications, with 28,485 in FY 2018; followed by Guatemala (10,177), El Salvador (9,157), China (8,114), and Mexico (6,636).Meanwhile, 111,887 defensive asylum applications were filed with the Department of Justice’s immigration court system, known as the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), in FY 2018—an 8 percent decrease from 121,418 applications filed a year earlier.What is the asylum approval rate?According to USCIS, in FY 2018, 30 percent of affirmative asylum adjudicated petitions were approved, a decline from the 43 percent in FY 2016 and 37 percent in FY 2017.The same downward trend also applies to asylum petitions adjudicated by immigration courts. In FY 2018, 33 percent of such petitions were approved, versus 43 percent in FY 2016 and 37 percent in FY 2017.How many people receive asylum status?According to the most recent data at the time of this writing, in FY 2016, 20,455 individuals, including principal applicants and their spouses and/or unmarried children under age 21, were granted asylum after seeking protection upon or after arrival in the United States—a 22 percent drop from 26,124 a year earlier. An additional 5,490 individuals outside the United States were approved for asylum as immediate family members of principal applicants. (Note that this number reflects travel documents issued to these family members, not their arrival in the United States.)The big drop in asylum grants and the follow-to-join cases are mainly due to the mounting backlog in the USCIS Asylum Division, as a growing number of USCIS asylum officers have been diverted from the affirmative interview process to conduct credible and reasonable fear screening interviews with adults and families apprehended or found inadmissible at the U.S. border who express an intention to seek asylum.China was the top country of origin for those receiving asylum, with 4,484 persons (or 22 percent of total asylum grants). The next four largest countries of origin were El Salvador (2,157), Guatemala (1,949), Honduras (1,505), and Mexico (919). Together, nationals of these five countries made up 32 percent of those receiving asylum in FY 2016.What is the current backlog for asylum applicants?Due to the large application volume and limited resources, both the affirmative and defensive asylum systems have extensive backlogs. At the end of January 2019, according to USCIS, there were 352,277 affirmative cases pending; EOIR reported 821,726 total immigration cases pending, of which MPI estimated roughly 30 percent were defensive asylum ones.How many unauthorized immigrants are in the United States?The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants resided in the United States in 2016. About half of all unauthorized immigrants resided in three states: California (27 percent), Texas (14 percent), and New York (8 percent). The vast majority (82 percent) lived in 174 counties with 10,000 or more unauthorized immigrants each, of which the top five—Los Angeles County, CA; Harris County, TX; Cook County, IL; Orange County, CA; and Queens County, NY—accounted for 20 percent of all unauthorized immigrants.Note: MPI is among a small number of organizations that generate estimates of the unauthorized population because the Census Bureau does not. It is important to acknowledge that the estimates issued by MPI and others (including the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Pew Research Center, and Center for Migration Studies of New York) are based on different methodologies and data sources. Hence the estimates are not fully comparable.Where are unauthorized immigrants from?Mexicans and Central Americans are estimated to account for roughly two-thirds (67 percent or 7.6 million) of the unauthorized immigrants in the United States as of 2012-16, MPI estimates. About 1.8 million (16 percent) were from Asia; 685,000 (6 percent) from South America; 579,000 (5 percent) from Europe, Canada, or Oceania; 351,000 (3 percent) from the Caribbean; and 318,000 (32 percent) from Africa.The top five countries of birth for unauthorized immigrants were Mexico (53 percent), El Salvador (6 percent), Guatemala (5 percent), and China and Honduras (3 percent each).How many unauthorized immigrants live with children under age 18?As of 2012-16, about 4 million unauthorized immigrants (37 percent of the overall unauthorized population ages 15 and older) lived with one or more children under age 18, MPI estimates. Of this group, about 82 percent (3.3 million) resided with at least one U.S.-citizen child under age 18, and 17 percent (697,000) lived with only non-U.S.-citizen children.How many children under age 18 live with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent?Approximately 5.1 million children under age 18 lived with an unauthorized immigrant parent during the 2012-16 period, representing 7 percent of the U.S. child population. About 80 percent (4.1 million) of these children were U.S. citizens, another 16 percent (809,000) were themselves unauthorized, and 3 percent (167,000) were legally present, including LPRs and those with temporary visas.How many people were eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and how many applications have been received since its launch in 2012? The DACA program, announced on June 15, 2012, offered a two-year grant of deportation relief and work authorization to eligible young unauthorized immigrants. Requirements for eligibility included:MPI estimates that as of 2018 approximately 1.3 million people met all criteria to apply under the original DACA program, 408,000 met all criteria except for education, and 120,000 would be eligible upon turning 15 provided they remain in school.However, on September 5, 2017, the Trump administration announced the rescission of DACA, with a six-month wind-down. This decision has been challenged in multiple federal courts and a nationwide injunction has kept the DACA program in place, but only for people who currently have or in the past have had DACA benefits.Between August 15, 2012, when USCIS began accepting applications, and September 30, 2018 (the most recent data available at the time of this writing), 908,755 initial applications were accepted for consideration. Thus, as of September 30, 2018, about 70 percent of the immediately eligible population had applied. USCIS approved 823,283 (or 91 percent) of these initial applications; 79,763 (9 percent) were denied, and the remainder were pending.The top states of residence for accepted initial applications since the program’s inception are California (27 percent), Texas (16 percent), New York (6 percent), and Illinois and Florida (5 percent each). The top countries of origin are Mexico (78 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and Peru and Brazil (1 percent each).On June 5, 2014, USCIS began accepting DACA renewal applications, and as of September 30, 2018 had accepted 1,352,730 such applications (with some DACA holders renewing for the second or third time). By the end of September 2018, 96 percent (1,297,626) of the renewal applications had been approved, with 3 percent (40,392) pending, and 1 percent (13,717) denied.How many unauthorized immigrants were active participants of the program?As of August 30, 2018, according to most recent data from USCIS, 699,350 individuals were current DACA recipients. MPI estimates that 54 percent of the immediately eligible population as of 2018 were participating the program.The top states of residence for DACA active participants were California (29 percent), Texas (16 percent), Illinois and New York (about 5 percent each), followed by Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina (about 4 percent each).The top countries of origin of active DACA program participants were Mexico (80 percent), El Salvador (4 percent), Guatemala (3 percent), Honduras (2 percent), and Peru and South Korea (1 percent each).How many people are covered by Temporary Protected Status?Since the enactment of the Immigration Act of 1990, the United States has occasionally granted a form of humanitarian relief called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) when the home countries of foreign nationals in the United States experience natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other circumstances making return unsafe. TPS offers work authorization and protection from deportation for six- to 18-month periods. The first country to be designated for TPS was El Salvador in 1990 to protect Salvadorans who had fled the country’s civil war. Since 1990, 22 countries have been designated for TPS. Ten countries currently are designated: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. TPS protects nearly 318,000 people from ten countries, with the largest groups being Salvadorans (195,000), Hondurans (57,000), and Haitians (46,000).The Trump administration has announced that it will not extend TPS for immigrants from Sudan, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, Nepal, and Honduras when those designations expire. As a result, 98 percent of grantees could lose permission to work and protection from deportation—with the Haitian designation originally set to end on July 22, 2019; the Salvadoran one on September 9, 2019; and for Honduras on January 5, 2020.However, there have been several legal challenges, including one (Ramos v. Nielsen) that resulted in a preliminary injunction barring termination of the Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador designations. The nationals of these four countries will receive automatic extension of TPS and work permits as long as the injunction remains in place.How many unaccompanied children and families have been apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border?Apprehensions at the Southwest border grew significantly in the first five months of FY 2019, due to the increase in families seeking asylum. Between October 2018 and February 2019, the most recent period for which data are available, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more than 136,000 minor children and adults travelling as family units and about 27,000 unaccompanied children along the Southwest border. This represents a significant uptick over the 107,200 family units and 50,000 unaccompanied children apprehended in all of FY 2018. These children and families are primarily from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.Note: The term “family unit” refers to individuals—either a child under 18 years old, parent, or legal guardian—apprehended with a family member by the U.S. Border Patrol.Note: The government fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30. All figures for immigration control and enforcement given here are for the fiscal year. The data presented here are the most recent offered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).How many apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants occur at the border annually?CBP reported a total of 404,142 apprehensions at both southern and northern borders in 2018, a significant increase from 310,531 in 2017, and closer to the 415,816 apprehensions in 2016. Ninety-eight percent of Border Patrol apprehensions in 2018 occurred along the Southwest border. While apprehensions were up in 2018, they remained a small share of the 1.6 million that occurred during the peak year of 2000.Note: Apprehensions are events, not individuals. In other words, the same individual can be apprehended more than once, with each apprehension counted separately.How many people are arrested by ICE within the United States yearly?ICE made 158,581 administrative arrests in 2018, up 11 percent from a year earlier. An administrative arrest is the arrest of an individual for a civil violation of U.S. immigration law, which is subsequently adjudicated by an immigration judge or through other administrative processes.How many people are deported per year?Removals and returns result in the confirmed movement of inadmissible or deportable aliens out of the United States. Both ICE and CBP conduct removals and returns. There were 256,085 removals and returns carried out by ICE in 2018, an increase of 13 percent from 2017. Data do not appear to be publicly available on the number of removals and returns conducted by CBP for 2017 or 2018.How many immigrants are naturalized citizens?In 2017, 22 million immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens, accounting for 49 percent of the total foreign-born population (44.5 million) and almost 7 percent of the U.S. population (325.7 million), according to ACS estimates.Of the 22 million naturalized citizens, 27 percent were naturalized between 2010 and 2017, 31 percent between 2000 and 2009, and 42 percent prior to 2000.How many immigrants become U.S. citizens annually?USCIS naturalized 707,000 LPRs in 2017. The total number of immigrants receiving U.S. citizenship decreased by 6 percent from 753,000 in 2016, even though the number of petitions filed increased from 972,000 in 2016 to 987,000 in 2017. The decrease in naturalizations granted is a combination of factors including longer processing time due to higher demand (8.1 months in 2017) and applications denials (83,000 in 2017).From a historical perspective, naturalizations have increased dramatically in recent decades. On average, fewer than 120,000 LPRs became citizens each year between 1950 and 1969, 210,000 in the 1980s, 500,000 in the 1990s, and 680,000 during the 2000s.Naturalizations reached an all-time high in 2008, increasing 59 percent from 660,000 in 2007 to 1,047,000 in 2008. This came as a result of impending application fee increases and the promotion of U.S. citizenship in advance of the 2008 presidential elections. Between 2010 and 2017, the average annual number of naturalizations was about 712,000.How many foreign nationals become U.S. citizens through military naturalization?In 2017, 6,900 foreign-born military personnel naturalized as U.S. citizens—a 23 percent drop from 2016 when 8,900 military personnel became Americans. Since 2002, 118,100 foreign-born military personnel naturalized on U.S. soil. Another 11,500 became citizens overseas or aboard Navy ships.Where are newly naturalized citizens from?Of those who naturalized in 2017, 17 percent were born in Mexico (119,000), roughly 7 percent in India (51,002), and 5 percent each in China (38,000) and the Philippines (37,000). Immigrants from these four countries, together with those from the Dominican Republic (30,000), Cuba (26,000), Vietnam (19,000), El Salvador (17,000), Colombia (16,000), and Jamaica (15,000), comprised the top ten countries of birth for newly naturalized citizens in 2017. These ten countries accounted for 52 percent of the 707,000 new U.S. citizens that fiscal year.Table 5. Top Ten Countries of Origin of Newly Naturalized Citizens, 2017Source: DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2017.Where do newly naturalized citizens live in the United States?In 2017, 57 percent of the newly naturalized lived in one of five states. California had the largest number of newly naturalized citizens, with 22 percent (157,000), followed by 12 percent in New York (86,000), 10 percent in Florida (70,000), 7 percent in Texas (51,000), and 6 percent in New Jersey (39,000).The top five metropolitan areas with the largest number of naturalizations were New York-Newark-Jersey City (113,000), Los Angeles-Long Beach (59,000), Miami-Ft Lauderdale-West Palm Beach (45,000), Washington-Arlington-Alexandria (30,000), and Chicago-Naperville (23,000). These five metropolitan areas accounted for over a third (38 percent) of all naturalizations in FY 2017.How many green-card holders are eligible to naturalize?According to the latest available DHS estimates, about 8.9 million of the 13.2 million green-card holders residing in the United States on January 1, 2014 were eligible to naturalize.How long does it take on average for green-card holders to naturalize?On average, immigrants held green cards for eight years before becoming U.S. citizens in 2017—an average year longer than green-card holders in 2016. The time varied by country of origin: African- and Asian-born immigrants spent an average six years in LPR status before naturalization, followed by those born in South America (eight years), Europe (nine years), Oceania (ten years), and North America (including Central America, eleven years).In general, naturalization requires being at least 18 years of age, passing English and civic exams, and for most, residing in the United States with LPR status continuously for at least five years (three years for those married to a U.S. citizen).How many visa applications for permanent immigration (green cards) are backlogged?Notes on Visa BacklogsTwo types of backlogs impact the issuance of green cards.The first is due to visa availability (with caps established in 1990):The second type of backlog is due to processing delays of applicants' documents, which is related to government processing capacity as well as increased background and criminal checks.In February 2019, the U.S. government was still processing some family-sponsored visa applications dating to August 1995, and employment-related visa applications from August 2007.According to data on the petitions submitted to the State Department, there were about 3.8 million applicants (including spouses and minor children) who were on the waiting list as of November 1, 2018, the first time the backlog dropped in recent years.The overwhelming majority of backlogs were family-sponsored applicants (3.7 million, which includes the principal applicant and their immediate family members). About 121,000 were employment-sponsored applicants and their families.Of the overall 3.8 million applicants, 1.2 million were citizens of Mexico, followed by those from the Philippines (314,000), India (299,000), Vietnam and China (with 232,000 each). Family- and employment-based prospective immigrants who are waiting to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident from within the United States are not included in the State Department estimate.USCIS also publishes backlog statistics but only for petitions approved in one of the five employment-based categories. USCIS data show that close to 395,000 approved employment-based immigrant petitions were awaiting a priority date based on the May 2018 Department of State Visa Bulletin. The figure corresponds to the number of primary applicants covered by these petitions but excludes their dependents. To MPI knowledge, USCIS did not publish backlog statistics on other types of green card applications the agency adjudicates.In other words, the overall number of people waiting for a green card—within and outside of the United States—is likely to be larger than the 3.8 million reported by the State Department (as of November 2018) and 395,000 reported by USCIS (as of May 2018).Additional Data Resources:Jie Zong is an Associate Policy Analyst providing quantitative research support across MPI programs.Jeanne Batalova is a Senior Policy Analyst at MPI and Manager of the Migration Data Hub.Micayla Burrows is an intern with MPI's National Center on Immigrant Integration Policy.Use our interactive maps, with the latest available data, to learn where immigrant populations, by country or region of birth, live in the United States—at state, county, and metro levels.

                        Senior White House aides met Sunday afternoon to discuss how to roll out the controversial move affecting hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.

Senior White House aides huddled Sunday afternoon to discuss the rollout of a decision likely to ignite a political firestorm — and fulfill one of the president’s core campaign promises.The administration’s deliberations on the issue have been fluid and fast moving, and the president has faced strong warnings from members of his own party not to scrap the program. Story Continued BelowTrump has wrestled for months with whether to do away with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA. But conversations with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who argued that Congress — rather than the executive branch — is responsible for writing immigration law, helped persuade the president to terminate the program and kick the issue to Congress, the two sources said. In a nod to reservations held by many lawmakers, the White House plans to delay the enforcement of the president’s decision for six months, giving Congress a window to act, according to one White House official. But a senior White House aide said that chief of staff John Kelly, who has been running the West Wing policy process on the issue, “thinks Congress should’ve gotten its act together a lot longer ago.”

                    By MICHAEL GRUNWALDWhite House aides caution that — as with everything in the Trump White House — nothing is set in stone until an official announcement has been made. Trump is expected to formally make that announcement on Tuesday, and the White House informed House Speaker Paul Ryan of the president’s decision on Sunday morning, according to a source close to the administration. Ryan had said during a radio interview on Friday that he didn’t think the president should terminate DACA, and that Congress should act on the issue.  A spokesman for Ryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement, “A decision is not finalized. We will make an announcement on Tuesday.”The president’s expected decision is likely to shore up his base, which rallied behind his broader campaign message about the importance of enforcing the country’s immigration laws and securing the border. At the same time, the president’s decision is likely to be one of the most contentious of his early administration, opposed by leaders of both parties and by the political establishment more broadly.Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politicsBy signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The White House and Congress have tried to pass the issue off on each other – with each arguing that the other is responsible for determining the fate of the approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants who are benefiting from DACA. Though most Republicans believe that rolling back DACA is a solid legal decision, they are conscious of the difficult emotional terrain. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch joined Ryan in cautioning Trump against rolling back the program.The president is likely to couch his decision in legalese. Many on the right, even those who support protections for children brought into the country illegally through no fault of their own, argue that DACA is unconstitutional because former President Barack Obama carried it out unilaterally instead of working through Congress. Some Republican lawmakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, have said that Congress needs to pass a law to protect the so-called Dreamers. “My hope is that as part of this process we can work on a way to deal with this issue and solve it through legislation, which is the right way to do it and the constitutional way to do it,” Rubio told CNN in June.

                    By MATTHEW NUSSBAUMTrump’s expected decision to scrap DACA within six months represents another challenge for Ryan and fellow congressional Republicans, who are facing an end-of-September deadline to avert a government shutdown and government debt default, while also tackling a Hurricane Harvey relief package and a major tax reform push.It’s not clear that Congress will be able to come to an agreement on the future of DACA.Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who previously said he was very disappointed by Trump’s lack of action on DACA, expressed fresh frustration on Sunday night with the idea of a delayed implementation.“Ending DACA now gives chance 2 restore Rule of Law. Delaying so R Leadership can push Amnesty is Republican suicide,” King tweeted.Meanwhile, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who has called on Trump to stand up for the Dreamers, tweeted out her displeasure with Trump’s expected announcement.“After teasing #Dreamers for months with talk of his 'great heart,' @POTUS slams door on them. Some 'heart'...” she wrote.Missing out on the latest scoops? Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.

The program is now set to end on March 5, six months after US Attorney Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration planned to phase out DACA, which has protected as many as 800,000 undocumented people.The failure to protect these people would be a tragedy, because the program has changed many, many lives for the better, as my research and that of others has shown. It took them out of limbo and let them contribute to their families, communities, and the US economy.When the Obama administration launched DACA in 2012, it amounted to a natural experiment: What would happen if you gave a portion of the overall population of undocumented immigrants fresh access to employment and other opportunities?Immigrants who applied for protection under the program — enrollment is not automatic — were at least temporarily shielded from deportation. They also got temporary Social Security numbers and two-year work permits. To qualify, they had to have arrived in the US before 2007 (at 15 years old, or younger), been 30 or younger in 2012, and either have a high-school degree or be enrolled in high school or similar educational program.When the program began, I started a national research project to study the effects on its beneficiaries. Those effects were profound: Under DACA, beneficiaries saw increased educational attainment, higher social mobility, and better mental health.My research into undocumented immigrants predates DACA. From 2002 to 2015, I followed 150 undocumented young adults in Los Angeles, examining how they transitioned to adulthood in a context of limited rights. In Lives in Limbo: Undocumented and Coming of Age in America, I compared a group of people who attended college with a group that had left school at or before high school graduation.Pre-DACA, even those young adults who had attained advanced degrees found their work and life outcomes limited — and unusually similar to those of less-educated peers. Lacking Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, and other credentials, college graduates found they had little choice but to enter the informal, low-wage labor market.In 2011, I sat across an auto assembly plant lunchroom table from Jonathan, who had not graduated from high school, and Ricardo, who had two postsecondary degrees. If Ricardo had been a citizen, he would have had his choice of attractive job possibilities, but both, now in their late twenties, faced the same limited work options.Many people I interviewed described chronic headaches, toothaches, ulcers, difficulty sleeping problems, eating disorders, and thoughts of suicide. They had grown up in communities around Los Angeles and (as a result of the 1982 Supreme Court decision Plyler v. Doe, which opened the door to a K-12 education) they had attended school alongside American-born and citizen peers.But at a critical stage in their lives, their immigration status blocked important rites of passage — they couldn’t get getting driver’s licenses, after-school jobs, or financial aid for college. (Many colleges would allow them to enroll, but they were disqualified from federal financial aid.)Life in the shadows enacts a heavy toll. In my book, using a term from sociology, I argued that illegality was a “master status”: a binding constraint that overwhelmed all other traits and achievements. It acted as a lead weight that eventually dragged them down.The undocumented young adults in my study were the embodiment of Langston Hughes’s “dream deferred.”But with DACA, things changed for many of these same people. In 2013, my research team surveyed nearly 2,700 DACA-eligible young adults. Moreover, beginning in 2015, we carried out two waves of in-depth, in-person interviews with 481 DACA beneficiaries in six states: Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, New York, and South Carolina.Just 16 months into the program, 59 percent of respondents reported having found a new job. Over one-fifth of the people we surveyed had obtained a paid internship.Undocumented immigrants aren’t forbidden from having credit cards or bank accounts, but having a Social Security number makes getting these financial tools a lot easier. Almost one-half of our survey respondents opened up their first bank account after receiving DACA, and a third acquired their first credit card. Close to 60 percent of our respondents had obtained a driver’s license.Twenty-one percent of those we surveyed reported that their access to health care had improved, sometimes because they had access to health plans provided by schools or employers.DACA’s benefits appear to be greatest for people with degrees from four-year colleges. They were more than 1.5 times as likely to obtain new jobs and increase their earnings than DACA beneficiaries who never went to college. It seems they were finally able to make full use of their credentials and networks.Our findings are now a couple of years old, but they have been corroborated. Six months ago, the political scientist Tom K. Wong, of UC San Diego, released results from a similar survey of DACA beneficiaries that found that 69 percent of respondents reported moving to a job with better pay. More than half moved to a job that they thought better fit their education and training, or offered better working conditions.Much of the political and media coverage of this group has focused on the academically gifted, but, in terms of distance traveled, DACA’s biggest success stories involve moderate achievers. Most undocumented immigrant youth end their schooling before entering college. (In fact, more than 40 percent fail to complete high school.)Many of our respondents reported that DACA led them enroll in community college or in jobs-training programs sponsored by community-based organizations. DACA beneficiaries who completed certificate or licensing programs — in fields like nursing, dentistry, construction, and cosmetology — experienced significant growth in salary. Sixty-eight percent who did so told us their hourly salaries increased from the $5-to-$8 range to more than $14 an hour.Less tangible, but equally important, is DACA’s positive role in improving the mental health and general well-being of its beneficiaries. More than two-thirds of recipients told us they were less afraid of law enforcement and of being deported. (Fifty-nine percent of our respondents say they would report a crime now in a situation when they wouldn’t before.)Being able to get a driver’s license or to obtain lawful employment is about more than transportation and work: It’s about not having to always look over your shoulder. Nearly 70 percent indicated that they feel less stress in general.Eighteen-year-old Carolina, who is from Illinois, told us, “My freshman and sophomore year, I did really bad [in school], mostly because I was just not motivated because … all of this is going to be worthless in the end.” With DACA, her mindset changed: “OK, I actually have a chance,” she said.Failing to replace DACA would also have negative consequences for the schools, hospitals, tech firms, courts, and community organizations for which this population is now able to work. There are now thousands of “DACAmented” teachers in US schools.While not a perfect policy — only a pathway to citizenship would offer that — DACA has provided a significant boost to a large number of young people. The research is clear that DACA beneficiaries have made truly impressive economic and educational gains.Our elected officials still have a chance to correct the mistake of ending this important program. Failing to do so would hurt the lives of thousands of people in cruel fashion and to no purpose. It would be a stain on the soul of our nation.Roberto G.

  President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deport most illegal
immigrants who encounter law enforcement, and Attorney General Jeff
Sessions is attempting to withhold federal funds from local police
departments that do not cooperate with DHS in that
effort.1 Underlying both actions is the belief
that illegal immigrants are a significant source of
crime.2 This brief uses Texas Department of
Public Safety data to measure the conviction and arrest rates of
illegal immigrants by crime. In Texas in 2015, the criminal
conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of
native-born Americans. Moreover, the conviction and arrest rates
for illegal immigrants were lower than those for native-born
Americans. This result holds for most crimes.The vast majority of research finds that immigrants do not
increase local crime rates and that they are less likely to cause
crime and less likely to be incarcerated than their native-born
peers.3 There is less research on illegal
immigrant criminality, but what research there is shows that
illegal immigrants have lower incarceration rates nationwide and in
the state of Texas relative to native-born Americans, although they
have the same rates of re-arrest in Los Angeles County.4 Consistent
with those findings, immigration enforcement programs targeting
illegal immigrant criminals have no effect on local crime rates,
which indicates that they are about as crime prone as other
residents.5Continue to full version This brief uses data from the Texas Department of Public Safety
(DPS) obtained through a Public Information Act (PIA)
request.6 The Texas DPS data separately show the
number of convictions and arrests of illegal and legal immigrants
for 44 and 46 different crimes, respectively, in the state of Texas
by year from January 1, 2011, to November 15, 2017. This brief
reports the conviction and arrest rates for each subpopulation of
natives, illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, and all immigrants
combined. This allows for a comparison of conviction and arrest
rates between these subpopulations. This brief additionally
displays conviction and arrest rates by select crimes.Texas has these data because its law enforcement agencies
cooperate with federal immigration enforcement authorities at the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that check the biometrics of
arrestees in the state.7 The Texas DPS keeps the results of these
DHS checks that then allow a more direct look at immigrant
criminality by immigration status.8 The DPS data released by the PIA
request revealed slightly more arrests in 2015 than were reported
by another publicly available DPS report for the same
year.9 The quality of the Texas DPS data is
excellent and, if it errs, it is likely to overcount the
convictions and arrests of illegal immigrants because it counts
more total arrests than another DPS source.This brief reports the conviction and arrest rates for 2015
because that is the most recent year for which estimates are
available for the sizes of the legal immigrant, native-born,
and illegal immigrant populations residing in the state of
Texas.10 The numbers in this brief do not
represent the total number of criminal immigrants in the state of
Texas in 2015, but merely the number of convictions and arrests of
illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, and natives. There were
22,797,819 native-born Americans, 1,758,199 illegal immigrants, and
2,913,096 legal immigrants living in Texas in 2015.11 In that
year, natives made up about 83 percent of the Texas population,
illegal immigrants about 6.4 percent of the population, and legal
immigrants about 10.6 percent. The conviction and arrest rates for
the entire period of January 1, 2011, through November 15, 2017,
are nearly identical to those of 2015, so the choice of year makes
little difference. The DPS data that this brief analyzes are for
all arrests and convictions that occurred in the year 2015,
regardless of the year in which the crime was actually
committed.Controlling for the size of the population is essential to
comparing relative conviction and arrest rates between groups.
Thus, government agencies generally report the conviction rate as
the number of convictions per 100,000 members of that particular
group.12 The three subgroups this brief analyzes
are illegal immigrants, legal immigrants, and native-born
Americans. It is important to note that the Texas DPS data report
the number of convictions and arrests, not the number of
people actually convicted or arrested. For instance, if a
Texas court convicts a single person of two different offenses or
of the same offense twice, then the Texas DPS data will count that
as two convictions.Texas is an ideal state to study criminality by immigration
status for multiple reasons: the state of Texas borders Mexico; it
has a large illegal immigrant population; it is a politically
conservative state governed by Republicans; in 2015 it did not have
jurisdictions that limited its cooperation with federal immigration
enforcement; and it has a law and order reputation for severely
enforcing its criminal laws.Natives were convicted of 409,708 crimes, illegal immigrants
were convicted of 15,803 crimes, and legal immigrants were
convicted of 17,785 crimes in Texas in 2015. Thus, there were 1,797
criminal convictions of natives for every 100,000 natives, 899
criminal convictions of illegal immigrants for every 100,000
illegal immigrants, and 611 criminal convictions of legal
immigrants for every 100,000 legal immigrants (Figure 1). As a
percentage of their respective populations, there were 50 percent
fewer criminal convictions of illegal immigrants than of
native-born Americans in Texas in 2015. The criminal conviction
rate for legal immigrants was about 66 percent below the
native-born rate.Homicides supposedly committed by illegal immigrants garner the
most public attention.13 On November 30, 2017, a San Francisco
jury acquitted José Inés García Zárate, an illegal immigrant from
Mexico previously deported five times, of murdering Kate
Steinle.14 Her tragic killing galvanized public
support for harsher immigration enforcement and the construction of
a border wall and provided anecdotal evidence for then-candidate
Trump’s claim that illegal immigrants are responsible for a large
number of crimes in the United States.15There were 785 total homicide convictions in Texas in 2015. Of
those, native-born Americans were convicted of 709 homicides,
illegal immigrants were convicted of 46 homicides, and legal
immigrants were convicted of 30 homicides. The homicide conviction
rate for native-born Americans was 3.1 per 100,000, 2.6 per 100,000
for illegal immigrants, and 1 per 100,000 for legal immigrants
(Figure 2). In 2015, homicide conviction rates for illegal and
legal immigrants were 16 percent and 67 percent below those of
natives, respectively.Illegal immigrants made up about 6.4 percent of the Texas
population in 2015 but only accounted for 5.9 percent of all
homicide convictions. Legal immigrants made up 10.6 percent of the
Texas population but accounted for only 3.8 percent of homicide
convictions. Native-born Americans made up 83 percent of the Texas
population but accounted for 90.3 percent of all homicide
convictions (Figure 3).Commentators also disproportionately blame immigrants for sex
assaults and sex offenses.16 This brief combines sexual assault and
sexual offense into the criminal category of sex crimes. There were
28.6 sex crime convictions of illegal immigrants per 100,000 in
2015, about 7.9 percent fewer than for native-born Americans in the
same year (Figure 4). The sex crime conviction rate for legal
immigrants was 69 percent below that of natives. There were many
fewer sex crime convictions against immigrants, including illegal
immigrants, than against native-born Americans in Texas in
2015.There were fewer larceny convictions of illegal immigrants and
legal immigrants than there were of natives in 2015. There were 267
larceny convictions of natives per 100,000 while there were only
about 62 convictions against illegal immigrants and 74 against
legal immigrants (Figure 5). The larceny conviction rate for
illegal immigrants was 77 percent below that of natives. This is
one of the few crimes where the criminal conviction rate of legal
immigrants is greater than it is for illegal immigrants.Some commentators argue that there is “immigrant privilege” in
the criminal justice system whereby immigrants face fewer criminal
convictions even though they are arrested for more
crimes.17 However, the arrest rate for illegal
immigrants is lower than for natives overall but higher for just a
handful of individual crimes-very similar to the conviction rate.
Lower arrest rates for illegal immigrants overturns the “immigrant
privilege” hypothesis.In 2015, Texas police made 815,689 arrests of natives, 37,776
arrests of illegal immigrants, and 20,323 arrests of legal
immigrants. For every 100,000 people in each subgroup, there were
3,578 arrests of natives, 2,149 arrests of illegal immigrants, and
698 arrests of legal immigrants (Table 1). The arrest rate for
illegal immigrants was 40 percent below that of native-born
Americans. The arrest rate for all immigrants and legal immigrants
was 65 percent and 81 percent below that of native-born Americans,
respectively.Per 100,000 people in their respective groups, there were more
arrests of natives for homicide, sex crimes, and larceny than there
were arrests of illegal immigrants.The homicide conviction rate for illegal immigrants was 16
percent below that of native-born Americans in Texas in 2015. The
conviction rates for illegal immigrants were 7.9 percent and 77
percent below that of native-born Americans for sex crimes and
larceny, respectively. For all criminal convictions in Texas in
2015, illegal immigrants had a criminal conviction rate 50 percent
below that of native-born Americans. Legal immigrants had a
criminal conviction rate 66 percent below that of native-born
Americans.1 “Executive Order: Enhancing

By
Chris Nichols
on Thursday, August 3rd, 2017 at 4:04 p.m.
Candidate for California governor Antonio Villaraigosa jumped into the nation’s heated debate on immigration reform during a recent interview on MSNBC.The Democrat and former Los Angeles mayor rejected the idea that deporting undocumented immigrants was a sound strategy for reducing crime.His statement followed President Trump’s speech about combatting MS-13 gang members. The gang started in poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. It’s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000.Trump campaigned on the promise to deport millions of undocumented residents, often describing them as threats to public safety.Here’s what Villaraigosa said on July 31, 2017 on MSNBC."I think we all agree that people that commit violent crimes ought to be deported. But going after the undocumented is not a crime strategy, when you look at the fact that the National Academy of Sciences in, I think it was November of 2015, the undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born. That’s just a fact."Watch the interview here. We decided to examine this last point as part of our Tracking The Truth series, which fact-checks claims in the 2018 California governor's race.We interpreted Villaraigosa’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born.But we wondered whether this was really a settled matter.We set out on a fact check.Our researchWe started by checking out the 2015 National Academy of Sciences study Villaraigosa cited. It found: "Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates." The study added that "This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men."It continued: "Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by ‘issue entrepreneurs’ who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy."The academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government.Findings in a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support Villaraigosa's statement:"Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal immigrants are 69 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal and illegal immigrants are underrepresented in the incarcerated population while natives are overrepresented."The Cato study used information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for immigrants aged 18 to 54 who are incarcerated in the United States. To examine Villaraigosa's claim, we also relied on research into similar claims by our partner national PolitiFact. In July 2016, it rated Mostly True a statement by Libertarian candidate for president Gary Johnson that Mexican immigrants "are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic."PolitiFact found several studies that back up this claim by citing incarceration rates. It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed.PolitiFact’s findingsPolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.Looking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented. U.S.-born men are incarcerated in the state at a rate of more than two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California.The American Immigration Council also reported that 2010 Census data shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are "significantly lower" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma.Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said.Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors."They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," he told PolitiFact. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence."Crime trendsPolitiFact also noted that as the immigrant population has increased, crime has gone down, citing Ewing’s report.Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, the violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data.Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens."The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research," Bersani said.According to Bersani’s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations)."This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population," Bersani said.Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available.More research needed?The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime "remains confused" due to lack of data and contrary information.Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said.As PolitiFact reported in 2015, there isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated.PolitiFact California spoke about this critique with Ewing of the American Immigration Council, whose research supports Villaraigosa’s claim. He said he’s confident in the work that’s been done and said critics have used anecdotes, rather than full-blown research, to try to make their points.Ewing added that the studies backing up Villaraigosa’s statement are "from such a wide range of researchers using so many different methodologies and sources of data -- not everyone can be wrong."Our rulingVillaraigosa said "undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born."He cited a 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences that backs up this claim.In a fact check last year, PolitiFact rated a similar claim Mostly True. It cited additional studies by scholars and partisan groups that show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born.It also found that researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime. It said this was a needed clarification.PolitiFact California agrees with these findings.We rated Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True.MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.UPDATE: We have added information to the ‘Our research’ section of this fact check from a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute.

    FNC's Griff Jenkins provides the latest details.Illegal immigrants appeared to have “ambushed” two U.S. Border Patrol agents near the Texas border with Mexico and bashed their heads with blunt objects -- possibly rocks -- killing one agent and sending another to a hospital in serious condition Sunday, a National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) official told Fox News.Rogelio Martinez, 36, was killed and another agent, who has not been identified, was injured while they were patrolling the Big Bend Sector, leading authorities to scour West Texas for the attackers, officials said. Although few details about the incident have been released, Brandon Judd, the president of the NBPC, told Fox News on Monday it appeared Martinez and the second agent were “ambushed” by a group of illegal immigrants.“We don’t know exactly what happened because we weren’t there. However, just from agents that were working in the area, reports are saying it was an attack and it would appear to be an ambush,” Judd said.He added: “There’s a high likelihood this was an assault on the agents.”
      Rogelio Martinez, 36, was killed while patrolling the Big Bend Sector in Texas.
      (Facebook)Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has offered a reward of up to $20,000 "for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible" for the attack.Martinez and his partner suffered traumatic injuries to the head and other injuries such as broken bones, FBI El paso said in a news release. Judd earlier told Fox News Martinez died of blunt force trauma to the head, indicating the attackers most likely used a rock or rocks during the assault on the two agents. The area surrounding where the attack occurred also indicated rocks were likely used as weapons. An FBI official also said that, counter to initial reports, neither agent was shot.“There were no indications the agents fired their weapons,” Judd said, citing accounts he received from agents who responded to the incident. He also said there were no signs of a stabbing.Martinez was notified there was illegal immigrant traffic in the area while the agents were patrolling near Interstate 10, in the Van Horn Station area, according to Judd. He began following “footprints” on a trail when the attack occurred. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a news release that Martinez&aposs partner made the initial call for help and reported they were injured and needed assistance.“There’s a high likelihood this was an assault on the agents.”Judd said details remained foggy on what led to the ambush and the FBI was investigating the incident.Judd did not further comment on the second agent’s condition.Martinez was from El Paso and had worked as a border agent since August 2013, assigned to the Big Bend Sector. He was also a father and brother, KFOX14 reported.Border Patrol records showed the agency&aposs Big Bend sector, which includes the area where Sunday&aposs attack took place, accounted for about 1 percent of the more than 61,000 apprehensions its agents made along the Southwest border between October 2016 and May 2017. The region&aposs mountains make it a difficult area for people to cross illegally into the U.S. from Mexico.The Border Patrol website lists 38 agents, not including Martinez, who have died since late 2003 — some attacked while working along the border and others killed in traffic accidents. Martinez is the second agent to have died this year.President Trump tweeted Sunday night: "Border Patrol Officer killed at Southern Border, another badly hurt. We will seek out and bring to justice those responsible. We will, and must, build the Wall!"The Associated Press contributed to this report. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.
